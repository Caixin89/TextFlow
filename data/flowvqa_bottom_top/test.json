        "text": "This step will moisten the dry stain so that it's more likely to come out. You don't need to take long just enough to thoroughly wet the fabric. , The cotton should be damp, but not dripping. Be gentle, and try not to stretch or tear the material. , Squeeze the juice directly from a lemon, or use a pre-bottled lemon juice product. Soak the stain thoroughly, so that the acidity begins to act upon the wine. , As the lemon soaks into the fabric, shake salt onto the area. Use your fingers to massage the salt and lemon into the stain. Work the salt in from the front and the back of the stained area for more dramatic effect.Standard table salt is fine, but any salt will do. You may even be able to use coarse sand and other gritty materials to scrub the stain. , Rinse the back of the stain in cold water from a faucet. Wring the fabric out with your hands, and massage it, paying special attention to the stained area. Do not stretch or tear the material, but don't be afraid to vigorously rub the stain. When the stain is nearly gone, wrap the garment in a clean towel to wring out most of the moisture. Always rinse from the back side of a stain. Wash it out of the fabric, not through it! , Squeeze more lemon juice directly onto the stain, in a concentrated dose. Lay the cotton out in the sun. Use a flat surface, if possible, so that the fabric does not stretch as it dries. The acidic lemon and the UV rays of the sun make for a natural, fabric-safe improvised bleach.",

After mixing colors in fondant, leave it to rest overnight or for 24 hours. Use cornflour for dusting your work area and also for dipping your cutters before using them. Freeze cupcakes for about an hour after icing. When drying the fondant pieces, keep them on cornflour dusted plates or trays. When making roses, let the bud dry completely before covering with petals. And then let each ring of petals dry after pasting to bud. Otherwise the rose will fall apart. Roll fondant 1/16 inch thick for covering the cupcakes and 1/8 inch thick for everything else. I have done my best to include each and every step.

        "text": "When someone sends us a 284 photo slideshow, we pretty much want to shoot ourselves. 32 minutes of near-fatal boredom.A few of us computer geeks and tv/film producers locked ourselves in a room for a year and set out to build a tool to help people out there save people like us from \"death by slideshows\". (Plus we think slideshows are so 1992.)So we built animoto.com. Think of it as a little black box filled with film & TV producers, tech nerds, robots, and indie rockers. You basically put your photos and a piece of music in one end, shake it up, and a photo music video pops out the other end -- all magically orchestrated to the music and with professional post-production technique. And it only takes a few steps. The robots pretty much do all the hard work. And creating Shorts (30 second videos) is free. You can make, remix, and share as many as you want.You need three things:1. Digital photos or images2. Some Music (although you can also choose from their library)3. Computer w/ Internet Connectionhttp://www.animoto.comCreate a video HERE or click on the steps above for more details.Here a DEMO VIDEO.Here a 60 second overview of what the black box technology does: First, choose the type of video you want to create. Either (1) an Animoto Short or (2) a Full-Length Extended Video. An Animoto Short is 30-seconds or less and is free. Full-length videos require a credit. You can either UPLOAD images from your computer or RETRIEVE them from another site. When you choose to UPLOAD images from you computer, use your CTRL or SHIFT key to choose multiple photos from your browser. When RETRIEVING images from another site, choose from Flickr, Facebook, Smugmug, Picasa, or Photobucket to import from. You will be asked to GRANT ACCESS to allow Animoto to access your photo albums. Then, choose the album you want to animate. Once your project is populated with your images, you can add/delete, drag to rearrange, rotate,or \"spotlight\" the ones you want to emphasize in your video. You can either SELECT a song from the Animoto collection or UPLOAD one from your computer. If you choose to SELECT a song from Animoto, you will be asked to choose a genre of music. You will then be given a list of soundtracks which you can preview, learn more about and/or select for your music video. Once you select a song, use the slider tool to choose the entry point of the song. Finalize your video by entering the video information that will appear as credits at the end of the video -- video title, video description, your name. Then click CREATE VIDEO . After a few minutes, voila! You will receive an email with a link to your music video! Review and if you want to put your images and music back through the render engine again to see what Animoto comes up with, just click the REMIX button and choose ONE-CLICK REMIX. If you want to edit the photo selection or music, click the REMIX button and choose EDITING REMIX. You now have your own personal music video!",

        "text": "I live in a decent sized apartment with what seems like an entire house full of belongings, space is hard to come by around here. I have 8 fishing poles ranging from light action to surf rods and wanted to create a storage solution that would keep them out of harms way and make them easily accessible. Here's what I came up with: The mount I created can hold 10 poles. You slip the tip into the smaller hole until there is clearance for the reel side to fit into the larger hole. For really long rods, you can disassemble them in the middle, feed them through the hole, then reconnect them to fit snug in the holder. I spaced my twopiecesof wood exactly 5ft apart, seems to be the sweet spot (but may not work if you have very short rods). YMMV. Feel free to get creative and change this around to fit your needs. You will need:Pieceof Wood (I used a 70 x 3.5 x 3/4 peice of pine from Home Depot, less than $5)Saw (Hand saw is fine, Home Depot and Walmart sell a nice Stanley setup with mitre box and pegs for $13)Drill Hole Saws (I used 2in for the larger holes and 1.5 in for the smaller holes) You could use only the 2in if you wish.6 Screws (I have Kreg pocket hole kit, my favorite tool ever. I highly recommend purchasing one if you don't have it!)Clamp (not necessary, but will make cutting and drilling the wood much easier) Cut the piece of wood at 33 inches and 66 inches. This will leave you with two equal pieces of wood 33 inches long. Make a mark every 3 inches on both pieces of wood. Find the middle of the wood short ways and create a + sign so you know exactly where to place the hole saw. Start with the larger hole, and cut into the wood every two marks. Do the opposite for the other piece of wood. I staggered the holes so when spaced apart, so one large hole was directly in line with one small hole, this allows you to arrange the rods in opposite order so all the reels aren't all on one side tangled together. Mount to ceiling. With the Kreg pocket hole system, this was a breeze. You could drill a pilot hole through the entire piece of wood vertically and fasten it using a 4in screw being careful not to split the wood. Ispaced them exactly 5 feet away, you will need to measure them to the size of your smallest rod, and make sure your biggest rod can still fit.",

        "text": "In this hyper-connected time, there are numerous ways in which you can choose to reach a recruiter after you meet them at a career fair. You may choose from the following methods: Send a text message in the same format as that of a business letter. Keep it short and concise, and simply mention that you are grateful for the recruiter's time. You may also choose to send them an email at their official email company email address. Send a traditional handwritten thank-you note, along with a copy of your resume.; , Send an invitation to connect with the recruiter you spoke to via Linkedin. Write a short thank you note attached to your invitation. This way, you can explore chances to learn about the organization and your recruiter. , Make sure you respond promptly with a thank you note immediately after the career fair is over. You should respond no later than 24 hours from the end of the career fair. This is because the recruiter's memory will still be fresh soon after meeting you. Additionally, you will be able to reference your conversation with the recruiter accurately, because you won't have forgotten anything. , To make your note more personal, try writing a handwritten note. This may be appreciated by employers, as it shows that you made a special effort to show your interest in the organization. If you had a noteworthy discussion with your employer at some point during the career fair, reference that as well. , Never try to write a long story, because overly long notes take too much time to read and can cause the recruiter to lose interest. Be specific and make sure your letter runs for no more than three paragraphs. Reference the key points you discussed with the recruiter. This tells him or her that you paid attention to the discussion. It gives an impression that you take things seriously and are a good learner.",

To perform this simulation, you will need an eyedropper, distilled water, a glass jar with a lid, bromothymol blue, a small clear container, and matches that have a high sulfur content.Bromothymol blue is a solution that changes color when pH drops and can be purchased online. The small container can be glass or plastic as long as it is clear. Adult supervision is recommended while using the matches.; , Pour about 10 mL of distilled water into the small clear container. The exact amount of water doesn't matter, but 10 mL is a good amount for this experiment. Use the eyedropper to gradually add the bromothymol blue to the distilled water until the solutions turns a light blue.10 mL is about equal to two teaspoons.When bromothymol blue comes into contact with an acid, the color of the solution turns yellow. , Light several matches and then drop them in a glass jar while still lit. Place the lid on to collect the gases. Wait until the matches burn out.With the lid on the jar you have trapped the carbon dioxide and sulfur gases produced by the matches. These gases are the same gases that get trapped in our atmosphere. Have adult supervision during this step , Open the jar containing the matches and pour the entire container of bromothymol blue solution into the jar. Put the lid back on the jar as quickly as possible to keep all of the gases in the jar.Shake the jar to mix the gases from the matches with the bromothymol blue solution. , Because bromothymol blue turns yellow when acid is introduced to it, you should observe that the solution has turned yellow. This experiment is a model of how gases can dissolve in water to decrease the pH of the water, making it more acidic.If the water doesn't turn yellow, you may need to burn more matches to trap more gas. Alternatively, you can use less water and try again.",

        "text": "Storing shovels, rakes, and all the other tools used in the garden can sometimes be a bit of a challenge. An artistic flare is often missing. We built a shed in the corner of our yard to replace the ugly tin shed that was poorly placed. Discussions about the exact wording went on for quite some time but eventually we settled on it. I created a Word document with Times New Roman at a font size of 430. I printed it out on eight or nine sheets of paper. Cutting the letters out as I went. All the sheets then need to be taped together. I tacked it to the wall and used a pencil to transfer the stencil. Followup with a black permanent marker. To match the theme I used the Internet to find an antique scythe, which I think is a wonderful addition. I used screws and wire to affix the scythe which is also extremely dull at the moment. Turns out permanent marker isn't so permanent. The winter was hard on it and it was showing through. I got a new \"king size\" marker and touched it up. Took me about an hour and a half. It now has that freshly printed look once again.",

[ELSE]: Adjust stencil and retrace.\n  - IF YES: Proceed to the next step.\n  - IF NO: Adjust the position of the stencil and retrace with the pencil.\n\n### PROCESS: Outline with Permanent Marker\n- Use a black permanent marker to go over the pencil outline.\n\n### INPUT: Decorate with Antique Tools\n- Use the Internet to find an antique scythe.\n\n### PROCESS: Attach Antique Scythe\n- Ensure the scythe is extremely dull for safety.\n- Use screws and wire to affix the scythe to the shed.\n\n### DECISION [IF]: Did the permanent marker withstand the weather? [ELSE]: Perform touch-ups.\n  - IF YES: No further action required.\n  - IF NO: Proceed to touch-up step.\n\n### PROCESS: Touch-Up Lettering\n- Acquire a new \"king size\" permanent marker.\n\n### OUTPUT: Refreshed Lettering\n- Touch up the lettering to restore the freshly printed look.\n- Time taken for touch-up: about an hour and a half.\n\n### END:\n- The garden tool shed now has an artistic and well-labeled appearance.\n```",

        "text": "Wow your guests and enjoy a delicious drink in style! After seeing an incredible watermelon keg online, I knew I needed to try it for myself. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a similar tap and pvc adapter, so I had to modify the design somewhat. ***update*** I've added pictures of a bigger melon keg we made for a recent party. For more info on my watermelon kegs or my other projects, you can check out my blog. From the hardware store: -Hose Bibb, Quarter Turn (that's the tap) -Faucet Lock Nuts (those black circles) -Brass Pipe Nipple 1/2\" (the piece with threads on both ends) -Coupling 1/2\" (what looks like a hex nut) -drill bit (optional) From the grocery store: -Watermelon (I used a very small melon for this demo, but you'll need a big one if you want more than two drinks out of it) -Saran wrap (or similar cling wrap) From your kitchen: -paring knife -ice cream scoop (a spoon could work in a pinch) -large bowl -blender -strainer / sieve From the liquor store: -vodka or your poison of choice (this is optional, but there's not much of a point without it, right?) Use your knife to cut the top off your melon. Try to keep the hole fairly small, but make sure it's big enough to stick your hand in. Make sure you cut on an angle (like you would if you were carving a pumpkin) so you can use the top as a lid without it falling in. You can cut a small notch out of the lid to make it easier to refill your melon after your guests inevitably finish off the original contents. Scoop out all of the delicious insides and set them aside. Using the drill bit, make a hole near the bottom of your melon. Be sure to put it on the prettiest side of your watemelon (this is, after all, what all your guests will be admiring). If you don't have a drill bit handy, a corkscrew would work. Using a paring knife, make the hole the same size as your coupling. Take your time with this step as you'll need a good fit if you don't want it to leak. Don't just shove your coupling in the hole as a bruised melon won't be watertight. Wash all the hardware. Screw your nipple into the coupling with one of the lock nuts inbetween. It's not nearly as nasty as it sounds. Push the coupling through the melon. Place a small piece of saran wrap over the coupling and cut an opening in the middle. The plastic wrap should help prevent leaks. Screw on the tap with a lock nut between the tap and the coupling. Wrap the excess saran wrap around the edge of the lock nut and trim it so it looks pretty. Throw the watermelon guts into a blender and turn it into juice. Pour the juice through a strainer to get the worst of the pulpy bits out. Add a generous helping of vodka and stir. Relax and enjoy a cool drink. Bask in the adoration of all your party guests.",

        "text": "Never try to replace plug wires on a running motor. Likewise, do not try to replace plug wires on a motor that's too hot to touch. , Once located, take note of the length and location of each wire. You will need to put each new wire back where you pulled its corresponding worn wire and it will be much easier if you write down what you've done. If you connect the wires in the wrong order, your engine will misfire and run poorly. Try marking each wire with tape and a number (corresponding to a spark plug location) so that you don't lose track., Replace the wires one at a time, and in a specific order or direction. This may help you remember which wire goes where, and it will reduce the risk of putting the firing order out of sync with the engine. Take your time. Start with one wire, and completely finish replacing it before moving on to the next one. The wire is connected at both ends. You must unplug each side before installing the new wire. The spark plug must fire when the piston is nearly at its highest point in the cylinder. Thus, it is imperative that you do not get this sequence out of order. Try starting at one end of your engine, and working across. , Use a spark plug wire removal tool to unplug and remove the wires. Use caution when you pull the wire from the plug. The newer engines have rubber boots that fit tightly over the plug, keeping it dry and clean. Remove the wire by pulling on the boot. If you pull on the wire instead of the boot, you may destroy the wire, and some of it will be left on the plug.Some of the wires can be very tightly stuck to the spark plug. Grasp the rubber boot firmly. If it doesn't pop off immediately, try twisting it back and forth while you pull it free. Inspect the boot for signs of carbon tracking. This will appear as a black line running from top to bottom inside the boot. If you notice this line, the spark plug must be removed for inspection.",

        "text": "In this instructable I will show you how to make a sturdy laptop stand out of cardboard.Why pay over 30pounds/$60 for a flimsy plastic laptop stand, when you can make a stronger and more environmentally friendly stand for free ?!When I thought of this idea I was skeptical and didn't think the cardboard would be able to support the heavy laptop, but after a bit of brainstorming and some strength tests i thought it was possible and decided to give it a go. When I had finished making it I tentatively lowered my laptop onto the stand, half expecting it to crumble and my laptop slide off the desk. Fortunately the process was uneventful and my laptop was perfectly happy sitting on top of its swanky new stand.Even though the initial test was a success i didn't want to publish an ible that would fall apart in a few days and drop peoples laptops, so i decided to go the distance and do an endurance test. Now its just under two weeks since the first test and everyday i have put the laptop on the stand in the morning and left it there all day and then taken it off in the evening.Results:Perfect, The stand is like new, nothing bent, frayed or crumpled, its been really good having the screen elevated, much more ergonomic than usual. Pretty easy, everyone has some laying around.If you dont have any:Ask freindsAsk in shopsLook behind shopsAsk at supermarketsAsk ParentsGo to recycling centerAsk anywhere that sells things, they will have some Now you have got the cardboard you can get started cutting out the shapes.You will need a knife; X-acto, Scalpel, Box cutter.-- It is much easer if your knife is sharpA metal ruler is also handy, you get nice clean cuts.-- Any ruler will do thoughCutting mat-- If you are doing this inside this will save your floor/deskYou Need:1 : BASE1 : BACK2 : SUPPORT6 : STAND'sOn the stand section you need to cut a 0.6cm wide 6cm tall slit for the support near the back. This stand is designed for a 13' MacBook but will accomodate laptops up to 15'It probbaly wont hold those laptops that are like portable desktops... Using some pins put all the peices toether and check you have the right sizes.Dressmakers pins are perfect. Now you have all the shapes cut and they all fit together we can assemble the stand.I used a hot glue gun for my stand but PVA or superglue would work just as well.Before gluing i would reccomend tracing out where you want the stands to be, this makes it easier and you are less likley to get it wrong.Glue the support bar to the base first. Then glue the stand sections to the base and support, then add the back and front.The laptop will be resting on the front pannel so use plenty of glue to make sure its strong. Infact use lots of glue all over.Remember, Spare the glue Spoil the stand ! hahahaLet the glue dry for a bit before you test the stand. Now get your laptop, and enjoy ergonomic bliss !I am really pleased with this laptop stand, its very strong and suits my needs perfectly.~ Thanks for reading, Dont forget to subscribe ! ~~ Check out all my other Instructables ~",

        "text": "You can ask your florist to do this while making your bouquets, or you can do it yourself with gold ribbon and pins. Wrap the stems of your bouquets in gold to add a little sparkle to your flowers and your look while coming down the aisle.If possible, try to talk to your florist in advance to see what your options are for adding gold to your bouquet wrapping. This saves you the hassle of having to redo things later on. , Add some gold to your look by adding gold accessories. For brides, this could mean gold necklaces, bracelets, earrings, hair clips and pins, and even sashes or belts around the wedding dress. For grooms, this may mean cufflinks, watches, or belts. You can opt for genuine gold accessories, or for more affordable novelty and costume jewelry that is gold plated or gold colored. If you are wearing diamonds, pearls, or other stones, look for jewels in a gold setting. , Gold shoes can add a bit of gold to the outfit for brides, grooms, bridesmaids, and groomsmen. Gold heels or ballet flats work for the more traditional bridal look, while gold sneakers or high tops work for both men and women at unconventional or casual weddings.Search local shoe stores for your gold shoe options, as well as online marketplaces. You can also dye white cotton or satin shoes a gold color to match the rest of your decor. Canvas shoes can even be painted gold.",

        "text": "Situated north of Los Santos County, Route 68 is one of the many major roads laid out throughout the state of San Andreas. To get there, take the Senora Freeway on the eastern edge of San Andreas and drive north. Make a left turn on the first exit you'll see after passing Route 13 into East Joshua Road. Drive through East Joshua Road westward passing Bolingbroke Penitentiary and you'll arrive at Route 68., At the end of Route 68, just after passing by a gas station, you'll find a bride running down the hill from a church. Stop near her and she'll approach your car and ask for a hitch. You character will automatically agree, and the bride will get inside your car. She won't say her name, but she will ask you to take her to home to Vinewood Hills., It's a short street in the Vinewood Hills area. Taking the same road where you found the bride, drive all the way down south towards Vinewood Hills. Count five corners and make a left turn on the fifth one to get to Kimble Hill Drive. She'll then ask you to stop once you get there, and she'll step out of your car. During the drive, the groom will appear and chase you down. To get rid of him, stop your car and step out. The groom will step out of his vehicle as well. Hit the groom with any melee weapon you have, like a bat or your bare fist, to knock him out and stop chasing you. Don't kill the groom though because this will scare the bride and she will run away. There's no time limit for driving the bride as well and you'll get additional 5 points for your driving skill.",

Therefore, at this point, all hopes of YOU obeying God should now be crushed.; , The question you will be wise to ask is why can't anyone obey God? The reason is Genesis 3. Read the whole thing. Then read Romans 5:12-21. Basically, our first parents, Adam and Eve rebelled against God and all creation was cursed as a result, and also as a consequence, we inherited a sinful nature which hates God, hates His commandments and weirdly tries to impress God by scantily obeying His commands. , God is going to punish ALL sinners, which includes you and me. However, the definition of sinner is one who doesn't obey God's commandments. However you know you should because God will punish sinners... Please stay and read step 4 , This person is Jesus Christ, who is God (Isaiah 9:6-7). He is our Savior! He died for all sins, all the SINS of every single human who has ever lived and is living and will live! 1 John 2:1-2 And He did this willingly because God loves us (John 10:17-18 and Romans 5: 6-11) , Being just, all sin has to be punished and punishment taken by the sinner or Jesus Christ who willingly chose to atone for ALL sins. Therefore, you receive this gift by believing in Jesus Christ as your Savior and submitting to Him as your Lord. This is a gift from God and even believing is a gift from God. All who believe in Jesus for the forgiveness of their sin will be saved (John 3:16) but all who disbelieve are condemned already (John 3:36) , In the past, it was easier to do sinful things, conversely, when God changes your heart, it comes naturally to do good things.",

        "text": "It was Gerrit Reitvild who first deconstructed a transport crate to reassemble it into furniture that was both affordable and could be easily constructed from the individual pieces. In that sprit this booklet is made to reveal a method to dismantle this wooden beast of burden, the pallet. Like a donkey it has to be broken-in and for the task you will needa lump mallet,a claw hammer,and a prybar. You will also need a scrap piece of wood, MDF or ply to use as a cushion to avoided damaging the wood when knocking pieces apart.Bare in mind that pallets come in various sizes, shapes and conditions, so you may find this manual to be more of a rough guideline then accurate instructions when applying them to your pallet. 1) Begin by turning the pallet upside down and knocking the chocks (wooden supporting blocks) out. 2) The technique here is to distribute your blows with the lump mallet between the three blocks (a, b and c) and gradually knock the sections apart. 3) Once you have done this to all three supporting sections place these pieces underneath the main body of the pallet. 4) Using the claw hammer knock the revealed nails through their holes. Try to get all nails out of the wood otherwise you risk damaging your tools when using the pieces for your next project. Knocking nails out of wood is a skill. A skill albeit that you most likely will never write on your CV but one that nonetheless require you to be patient and accurate. If nails bend use the lump mallet like an anvil and knock them against back it into shape with the claw hammer. If a nail becomes to malleable cut it in half using pliers or a hacksaw and try knocking it out again. 5) Once those nails are out use the prybar to remove as many strips of wood as you can. Depending on the number of strips the pallet has you may decide to remove all even number pieces using the odd strips as leverage, or Vice Versa. If this is proving difficult you may find it easier to turn the pallet upside down, again resting it on the chocks and hitting along each strip, distributing your blows (a, b, c and d) to loosen them. 6) To get the remaining chocks of their strip of wood, while standing the piece vertically use the lump mallet to knock pieces e and f off. Turn the piece around and repeat to chock g. Be careful when knocking the chokes of their strips to avoid squashing your fingers. Also take care to avoid kneeling or standing on the nails as they are ribbed and not for your pleasure. They also have shards of metal attached to them from however they were arranged in a nail gun. Try not to run your fingers along them otherwise you will receive metal splinters along with wooden ones if you decide not to wear work gloves. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtPmUZ-k3aI&feature=channel_page",

        "text": "This instructable will show you how to prepare and bake a fresh pumpkin for use in pies, breads, and other delectable treats. I'll add a separate instructable for how to actually make the pie and bread later, this is just preparing the pumpkin. For this instructable, you'll want to use pie pumpkins. These are smaller and smoother than jack-o-lantern pumpkins and taste much better. Pie pumpkins are closer to the size of a small melon, like a honeydew. 2 pumpkins will provide enough baked pumpkin for a pie and a couple of small loaves of bread. You'll also need:A sharp, non-serrated knifea cutting boardsome tin-foila large pan for baking First, you'll want to wash any dirt off the outside of your pumpkin. No one wants to eat dirt. Then, cut the pumpkin in half. I find it's easier to cut in a square around the stem and that weird spot on the base, since they're pretty woody areas. It's best to use a non-serrated knife for this, and to be careful. Make a lot of small short cuts rather than trying to go all the way through in one shot.Once your cuts go all the way around, pry the pumpkin apart. If your cuts are clean enough, this will be easy, but if they're not, you may want to try putting one half on the counter, and leaning on the other half to let your weight do the work for you. After you've separated your pumpkin halves, use a spoon to scrape out all the seeds and stringy stuff. I usually just throw all this away, but you can save the seeds for toasting if you like. When you're done, you'll have two nice clean pumpkin halves. Making them this clean before baking saves some trouble after they've been baked and are soft and mushy. Next you'll actually bake the pumpkin halves. Line a large pan with the tin-foil. This is kinda optional, but it saves a lot of time in clean up since the juices will run out and burn during baking. Because of the juices, you'll want to use a pan that has edges to it, not just a flat cookie sheet. Lay your pumpkin halves face down on the pan. Set the oven to around 350 degrees, or around 180 Celsius.Stick the pan in the oven, and then wait for about an hour and a half to 2 hours. The actual time will vary depending on how thick your pumpkins are and how hot your oven actually gets. You can check the pumpkins every so often to see if they are tender by sticking a fork in them. Once they're nice and soft that means they're done. Once your baked pumpkin halves have cooled enough to hold, grab one and use a spoon to start scraping the soft pumpkin flesh off the skin and into a bowl. Don't worry about the burned parts of the skin, but if there are any burned parts of pumpkin flesh, you may not want to include those. Throw away the leftover skins, or compost them, or whatever. In the final step of preparing your pumpkin, you're going to mash it. Grab that potato masher and give it some experience with a new type of produce. Mash to your heart's content. Or until your arms get tired. And that's it. Now you have pumpkin that is ready to be used for making tasty pies and breads. Usually, especially when making pies, I like to mix the pumpkin with the liquid ingredients and then blend the whole mixture to create an extra smooth pie filling. Enjoy, and go make some tasty goodness.",

        "text": "A extruder is useful for making fast coils of clay, handles, and decorative parts. most extruders come in two types, a wall mount (instructable in progress) and todays project, a easy and simple Clay Gun. insers the prepared tube, fill with soft clay, and crank the handle.... just like a plydough machine.... on;ly more useful..... this clay gun cost under 10$ and makes enough tubes for 3 diffrent die heads, though the parts are cheap enohugh to make a bunch. the parts: you will need: a caulk gun frame- I picked up this one for 4.95 at the local hardware store- this is a 13 inch gun, designed to use the \"regular\" sized tubes of glue and caulk a length of 1 1/2 inch schedule 40 PVC Pipe, this peice is 5 foot long and cost $2.30 1 1/2 inch caps to use as die heads i bout 4 at 70 cents a peice 1 1/2 inch test cap this was 35 cents for 2. you will also need a marker, a hacksaw with a sharp blade and a mesuring device. measure the pipe from one end and cut off a 8 inch peice drive one of the caps onto the pipe. this one ive cut 3 holes in the cap with a knife. I could have gotten cleaner results with a drill bit. keep the holes smaller than about 1 inch in diameter, (YMMV). this pattern makes a rope if you twist the clay as it extrudes... the test cap will bethe back seal forthe gun piston. trim off the outer flange so you only have a cup shaped peice. add a glob of glue (liquid nails) and glue to the piston head of the caulk frame. let dry for a hour or so. you make have to trim the caps or pipe to make fit.. a sanding block or a rasp works well for this. Finished- to load the gun, roll a ball of clay between your hand to make a 1 inch rope. insert the rope into the sylinder, and load 'er up! start sqeezin! this gun is also useful if you want toextrude materials you cant get in tubes- like stucco or plaster of paris..the gun tubes are cheap enough to bedisposable.... to clean, just pop off thecaps and wash out, or just chuck it into a bucketof water until its ready to be used again...

The right-foot shoe was my control, and the left-foot shoe was my first test. You will need: Your scruffy shoes Some toothpaste A plastic scrubber (or steel wool) -A friend of mine recommended using a toothbrush, but I found that it couldn't scrub hard enough. Put it onto the scrubber and not the shoe. You want the paste, which contains an abrasive (possibly sand), to stay with the scrubber. Scrub like you've never scrubbed before. This requires real vigour. See if you've missed any spots. Then scrub some more. If there is a little bit of yellow that won't come off, don't fret. That's the glue that's holding the rubber on. It seems to become more obvious when shoes are washed. Get a little bit of the toothpaste out of the scrubber. I didn't do this part when I dealt with the other shoe and it foamed up and soaked in. I had to spend a while getting it all out. There's probably some still in there. These shoes had quite a bit of dirt and dust in them. If yours are old and dirty, this step will benefit them. If they're new and you want to preserve the colour, ignore this. It might make them look faded. Rinse rinse rinse so your shoes don't smell like mint (although that might be nice). Squeeze out the water to dry faster. Just like new. The regular toothpaste works great, but I may try this again later on with a whitening toothpaste or a hardcore industrial-strength hand-cleaner.",

Repeat every 1-2 hours until sore throat is gone.The water should be warm, but not hot. Warm tap water is usually sufficient, or microwave 8oz of water in a microwave-safe container for 1 minute. For an extra immune-system boost, add some garlic to your gargle. Cut a clove of garlic in half and rub the cut side around the inside of your cup before adding the water. , Tea with lemon and honey is an excellent choice. Or try the following concoction that many people swear by: dissolve 1 tablespoon of honey and 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar in an 8oz glass of very warm water, stir well and drink up! Honey has many healing properties, and the acid in the vinegar is thought to help kill bacteria.Add a pinch of cayenne pepper to your tea or honey-vinegar drink to increase the healing and soothing effect., Overly dry air can cause a sore throat, or make it worse. Use a vaporizer or humidifier in your bedroom, and use your sore throat as an excuse to take a long, steamy shower. , Don't smoke and avoid irritants, such as wood smoke, as much as possible. If you have to go outside in cold weather, cover your nose and mouth with a scarf to avoid breathing in cold winter air. If there is a lot of air pollution in your area, consider buying a portable air filter to use near your bed or desk. , Minimize talking as much as possible, and get some rest.

You want to get to the foundation as soon as you can, to create a strong base for your piece. ,, Note: just lay down a basic beat to act as a template. Once you go to the other sections you can return to change things up a little based on the progressive sound of the song. Quite often I find I have a vision of what I'm trying to write and it will morph into something new. You have to be able to make adjustments along the way. , Start with a basic chord progression then build and change it from there. For example a chord progression may use I, III, and V (ex C, E, G) and fall into a: I, III, pattern for example (where I is the root of the chord and III and V are the next two higher notes in the chord). ,, You may have lyrics, then tailor a song to match them, or do the lyrics after the rhythm. The thing to keep in mind to to ensure you tell a good story. Don't be afraid to change lyrics or the music to achieve the best mutual fit. , Let the lyrics help guide you if you have lyrics. , Choose the mood or style of the song. You'll know you're there when you can't get the phrase (known as a \"lick) out of your head! Quite often a 2-8 word phrase will do it (i.e. \"shoulder lean\", \"love shack, baby love shack\", etc). ,,, Would you listen to it on the radio or change the station? Let others listen to it and make suggestions. , But remember that too many adjustments may make your song sound or \"taste\" terrible, so don't over correct.",

I have a bunch of less-than powerful Airsoft guns lying around, a bunch of random junk, adhesives, and metallic paint. Combine all of this, and I get a Steampunk Airsoft gun! I also wanted the gun to work. Maybe not be easy to cock, or load, or aim, but at least fire. This one fits that description perfectly. This gun is not up to my personal artistic standards, but I couldn't figure out something to edge the leather with to my satisfaction, or something to cover the exposed glued woods on the ends of the scope. Without further ado, here is my Steampunk Airsoft gun. The gun I chose had some accuracy issues so i decided to to take it apart and maybe fix that. I found the problem- a cracked barrel mount- and patched it up with Krazy Glue (CA glue). That fixed it wonderfully",

The objective is not only to achieve the Steampunk aesthetic but also to ensure the gun remains functional, capable of firing despite potential difficulties with cocking, loading, or aiming. There were some challenges faced in achieving the desired artistic standards, particularly in edging the leather and covering exposed glued woods on the scope's ends. The gun selected for modification had accuracy issues due to a cracked barrel mount, which was repaired using Krazy Glue.\n\n## Process Flow\n\nSTART: Begin the Steampunk Airsoft gun project.\n\nINPUT: Gather materials which include:\n- Airsoft gun with accuracy issues\n- Random junk\n- Adhesives\n- Metallic paint\n- Leather (for aesthetic purposes)\n\nPROCESS: Evaluate the Airsoft gun for functionality and accuracy.\n\nDECISION [IF]: Is the Airsoft gun suffering from accuracy issues?\n- Yes: Proceed to disassemble the gun.\n- No: Skip to the aesthetic modification process.\n\nPROCESS: Disassemble the Airsoft gun to identify the cause of the accuracy issues.\n\nINPUT: Inspect the internal components of the Airsoft gun.\n\nDECISION [IF]: Is there a cracked barrel mount?\n- Yes: Repair the crack.\n- No: Reassemble the gun and proceed to the aesthetic modification process.\n\nPROCESS: Repair the cracked barrel mount with Krazy Glue (CA glue).\n\nOUTPUT: The accuracy issue of the Airsoft gun is fixed.\n\nPROCESS: Reassemble the Airsoft gun after the repair is complete.\n\nPROCESS: Begin the aesthetic modification to achieve the Steampunk theme.\n\nDECISION [IF]: Can perfect edging for the leather be figured out?\n- Yes: Apply the edging to the leather.\n- No: Continue without edging.\n\nDECISION [IF]: Can a covering for the exposed glued woods on the scope's ends be found?\n- Yes: Apply the covering to the scope's ends.\n- No: Continue without covering.\n\nPROCESS: Apply random junk, adhesives, and metallic paint to create the Steampunk look.\n\nOUTPUT: A Steampunk-themed Airsoft gun that is functional but may not be easy to cock, load, or aim.\n\nEND: The Steampunk Airsoft gun project is complete.\n```\n",

        "text": "Everyone around the office has been talking about Marvel's The Avengers this week and we just knew that there had to be a fun craft in there for us to in honor of the movie! We put our thinking caps on and thought that a tie dye shirt in Captain America style was in order! This project was designed by in-house designer Lauri Eaton and she did an amazing job! We think Captain America fans out there would want to get this tie dye look for themselves! In fact, a lot of guys in the office wanted one after seeing what we made! Here's how you make one for yourself! Tulip One-Step Tie Dye in Red and Blue Tulip Fabric Spray Paint in Snow White Tulip Dye Zip Ties Tulip Surface Cover White cotton shirt (or use 50/50 blend for a more faded/vintage look) Freezer paper Scissors or X-acto Pencil or star printout Pinch middle of shirt and pull up. Apply zip ties as shown and secure tightly. Zip ties work best for this because they grab the material really tightly, oftentimes better than rubber bands! Pull the zip ties as TIGHT as possible. Use pliers if you need to! That's what our designer Laurie did! Rinse shirt in water and wring out. The water helps the tie dye set! Apply tie dye in between each of the binded areas. You will want to saturate each section and not leave any white. Once finished dyeing wrap in plastic surface cover. Freeze for 70 years! Just joking. Let it set for 6-8 hours. 6. Now run your shirt under the water in the sink until all the dye is out. The dye is out when the water runs clear! Cut off zip ties and place by itself in the washer and set to large load. Put it on the hottest water suitable for fabric and use a little laundry detergent. Dry in dryer or line dry. Next measure the middle bullseye area of the shirt. Print out or hand draw a star to this size on your freezer paper. Cut out star and center it in the middle of the shirt. Use a hot iron to press the design onto the shirt. Use fabric spray paint to spray inside stencil. The spray paint will give the star a more distressed look. You can also use Tulip Soft Fabric Paint to stencil on the design as well! Use a hair dryer to speed up drying time. Once dry, peel off stencil to reveal star! Here's the finished product! You can apply this technique to any natural fabric. Try making onesies, pillow cases, sheets, and more! Now go out there and unleash your inner superhero! Take on the world with a vengeance, Avengers style!",

        "text": "Just because sports like football, baseball, hockey, or soccer are widely popular doesn't mean that the kid will enjoy them. When thinking of exercise routines for your kids, think outside of the box. Things like dance, martial arts, boxing, gymnastics, swimming, biking, skateboarding, surfing, and skiing are all sports that they can enjoy.Other alternative sports include circus arts, dirt biking, fencing, rock climbing, and rugby.; , Pressuring a child to do what you want them to do can increase their anxiety and cause them emotional distress. Instead, let your child choose which types of exercise that they will participate in. Allow them to try out different types of sports and physical activities until they tell you that they like a certain sport or exercise., When children are really young, they may not have the cognitive development to understand complex rules or game strategies. Let children between the ages of 6-8 try a wide range of different sports and activities to determine what they enjoy doing the most. It's more important in these developmental years to develop basic hand-eye coordination and motor skills. By 9-12 years old, kids are ready to try out more complex sports and activities and can understand and learn rules. At this point, if you've kept them active, they should know what they enjoy doing.Good sports for kids ages 6-8 include T-ball, running, soccer, swimming, and martial arts. Great sports for children between the ages of 9-12 are football, basketball, hockey, and volleyball., Talk to the child and ask them about their interests. They may already be interested in joining a certain sport or activity. If this is the case, allow them to pursue the sport that they are interested in. Take notice of their body language and determine if they look depressed, sad, or angry. In addition, pay attention to verbal cues like long pauses in between words. These may all be signs that they feel uneasy or upset with having to participate in the sport.Sometimes children will refrain from telling adults the truth to satisfy them.",

        "title": "How to Clean and Re-wax a Surfboard",
        "text": "What's the matter? Got sand in your wax? The main problem with surfing, apart from the fact that it is almost impossible, is that you get sand in your wax, which turns your board into a manually operated belt sander, especially as you duck dive under waves. This is not such a problem in cold places, because you wear a nice long wetsuit. But in warmer spots, your legs/knees with soon resemble a raw souvlaki column. This instructable tells you how to clean the old wax off, and put new stuff on! This board has just been cleaned. There are a number of different ways you can clean the old wax off, but the best way, I think, is to leave it in the sun to let the wax soften, then scrape off with a board scraper (that I lost) or your driver's license (that I haven't lost). The license works better. You can remove the last of the wax by rubbing the board with a rag soaked in turps (turpentine). I've heard that Vaseline also works well for removing wax, but it's not as instant as turps and the fumes don't make you giggle as much as turps. If you are doing this on concrete, put something like a towel under your board... Choosing your wax! There are all different kinds of board wax to suit different water temperatures. Where I live, the water is about 22C at the moment, so I use Sexwax 3x cold water soft \"Quick Humps\". I'll leave that there. There's a big difference in types of wax, in warm water you want thicker wax, in California you can just about dip your board in diesel and have it wax up. Ask the surly guy with his pants halfway round his arse in the surfshop what to use for your local area. Now, rub the block of wax across your board, and then lengthways over the same area. Pay special attention to the rails - it's not considered 'cool' to have lots of wax on your rails because in theory it cuts down your speed on the wave. However, this is like worrying about the wall paper on the space shuttle. The only people who are good enough to notice a reduction in board speed have an army of groupies to wax their board for them. For regular surfing mortals, wax on the rails means you can hold and push the board down for duck diving - if your hands slip off during this process you cop a board in the face, 'Sticky rails to you, till we meet again' etc. So: sticky rails is nice rails. A note on board wax: There are good places to keep board wax and bad places to keep board wax. The dashboard falls into the second category. See pic. So this is what it should look like - you should have lumps of wax all over your board. It should resemble bad 70's wallpaper, but sticky. More lumpy is better. Right, now go get wet!",

        "text": "This Instructable will show you how to make awesome rainbow cupcakes that not only look good but taste good too! Your friends will only think it took you forever to make these cupcakes. Only you will know that it did not take all day to make them. To make awesome rainbow cupcakes you'll need the following: White cake mix (make sure it is not yellow or it will distort the colors) White frosting Water eggs or egg substitutes (egg whites) Food coloring (green, yellow, red, blue) Butter/ vegetable oil/shortening Large six tin muffin pan Cupcake liners Plastic containers to separate batter Mixer or spoon to hand mix batter Put the cupcake liners in the pan and double up on them because they keep the cupcake shape better. You can always take off one or both liners before presenting. Prepare the cake as per the directions on the box. I substituted egg whites for real eggs. Mix all the wet ingredients with the dry mix until smooth but do not over mix. Over mixing will cause the batter to be too dense when baked, it will not bake correctly and will be more like a pudding. Smooth batter also facilitates in mixing in the dye. Now this is the fun part because you get to be as creative as you want! Once you have added the food coloring, mix with a fork and add more food coloring as needed. The more food coloring you add the darker the rainbow colors will be. Now decide in which order you would like the colors of your rainbow and pour each layer, making sure to cover the previous layer. You can play around with the batter at this point and you can make some layers thicker than others or you can make your layers the same thickness. I tried to make these the same thickness. Using the baking instructions on your cake box, bake the cupcakes! Since rainbow cakes are no good to anyone if they are under baked, use a wooden skewer to check to see if they are done. If batter comes off on the wooden skewer bake a few more minutes. If the skewer comes out clean, your cupcakes are done! Take the cupcakes out of the cupcake pan and let them cool. The layers look great and the taking off the second cupcake liner allows you to really see the nice rainbow patter while the cupcake is still intact. I am showing the cupcake cut in half so that you do not have to \"destroy\" a perfectly good cupcake. :-) This is the easiest part. Once and only once the cupcake has completely cooled off, you can start frosting the cupcakes. All you have to do is open the can of frosting and start frosting. I used a dinner knife but any knife will do. Now that the cupcakes have been frosted, now it is time to dazzle your guests with your fantastic cupcakes!",

The resistance from the couch will stabilize your body while you do the twists. Lie down on the mat with your knees bent and place your feet under the couch.Alternatively, you can have a friend hold your feet down for you instead of the couch.; , Your upper body should be at a 45-degree angle to the floor. Hold out your arms in front of you and clasp your hands together. Clench your abdominal muscles, pulling your bellybutton in toward your spine. This is the starting position. Make sure your spine is straight and not rounded.In this position, your upper body and thighs should create a \"V\" shape. Your arms should be straight and fully extended in front of you, as well. Keeping your abs tight engages the deeper transverse abdominal muscles, which will help protect your spine during the exercise. , With your arms extended in front of you, twist your torso to the right side. Twist until your arms are parallel to the floor. Hold the position for a second or two and breathe out. Then, move back to the starting position and repeat the same technique for the left side. This is one repetition.If your shoulders begin to hunch while performing the exercise, re-straighten your spine. Try to do three sets of eight to 12 repetitions. If this is too difficult, then do three sets of five to eight repetitions.",

So if you're ever fishing and you run out of bait, or find yourself in a survival situation this could be good to know. To make this lure you will need the following: 1. One piece of 550 paracord about 4 inches in length. 2. One fishing hook. 3. Knife or pair of scissors 4. Lighter or matches. Take your 4 inch piece of paracord and pull the inner strands about 1 inch out Next place the hook inside the paracord like in the picture. Next step feel for the end of the hook inside the paracord, once you find the end of the hook cut the paracord even with it. Save one of the inner strands of the piece you cut off for the last step. Next take a lighter or a match and singe the end of the paracord so it can't slip off the end of the hook. Next untwist the inner stands and scrape them with your fingernail to fluff them up a bit. Next take the inner strand you saved from step 4 and secure the paracord to the hook by tying it around the paracord just above the hook part. Here are the instructions on video",

        "text": "Vegetables like carrots, peas and sweet potatoes offer a sweeter flavor than many of the vegetables children sometimes refuse to touch (like broccoli and brussels sprouts). As children are genetically driven to eat sweeter foods, it makes sense to start with the sweetest vegetables. You can even make them sweeter by adding a honey glaze for carrots, or maple syrup and brown sugar for sweet potatoes., Children are also genetically driven to avoid the veggies that look the most like leafy plants. Cutting, dicing, and blending can help disguise the leafiness, but starting with butternut squash or sweet peas may help get the ball rolling., Many people have a higher sensitivity to bitterness than others. This is especially true in children, and this sensitivity tends to decrease with age. So, by starting kids with kid-friendly vegetables, and slowly introducing the more difficult ones can get the child interested (especially if you make it a point to show them your enjoyment of the vegetables).",

I've seen similar styledpop-upsbefore and thought a heart would work really well. The card is also really minimal (which I love) and take about 20 minutes to make (that includes the card, insert and envelope). Download the popup insert template and print out on to a sheet of paper or thin card. I used pink paper but you can use any color you want. Using some scissors trim around the edge of the template. Place your piece of paper on a cutting mat (or a scrap piece of cardboard). Using a craft knife and ruler cut along the black lines (highlighted in yellow) andscorealong the grey lines. You can score the card with your craft knife (justdon'tpress too hard).Alternatelyyou can use a compass point or even a pin! Make the four valley folds as show in the image below (marked with thin yellow lines). Make sure your card is still resting on a flat surface and s-l-o-w-l-y fold the top of the card inwards and the bottom half of the heart should begin to push out. (You don't need to tape it to the tableI just did because I was taking pictures at the same time!) Make outer card and glue/tape popup insert inside. I just used a plain piece of paper which measured 9.5cm x 19cm and then folded it in half. I left mine blank (I really dig the minimal look) however if you want to decorate the outside then you can! Print out the envelope template. Cut, score and fold! I also made some paper pixel confetti to add to the card! Pop the card in the envelope and stick down. You can use glue or tape (or even some pretty washi tape). Happy valentines day everyone!!",

Major signs are dilated pupils, lifted shoulders, and feet pointed towards you.Women sometimes play with their hair, tilt their head, or become coy when they are attracted to someone.Men sometimes smile, sway, stretch, or gaze when they are attracted to someone. , Sometimes the best thing to do is just be honest and tell the person about your attraction to them. Be prepared for rejection and do not take it personal if they do not return your affection. As discussed, there are many factors involved in attractiveness and you are sure to find someone else who thinks that you are attractive. , A stable and healthy relationship requires that you value and appreciate each other. It is best when the attraction is mutual, but if that is not the case, consider moving on before you become too emotionally involved.",

Self-supporting nets are like tents, so you can find a spot that you would feel comfortable setting up a tent on.If you're inside, find a spot where you will feel the most comfortable and that has enough room for the net.; , Remove the net, as well as any rods, strings, and stakes, from its bag. Separate the net from the other parts., Spread the net over the area you have chosen. Pull the stake loops on the ends of the tent out to the corners of your sleeping area.If your net has a base, it will be easy to tell if you have it right-side up. If not, check to make sure any zippers are on top of the net. , The poles will be broken into small sections that are connected with an elastic rope. Connect the sections together to form the full length of the pole.If you have polls of different lengths, separate them so you don't accidentally start to use a short poll where a long poll is needed. , Depending on the particular net you have, there will either be fabric sleeves or clips that hold the polls in place. The polls will extend from one stake loop, over the top of the tent, and connect to the stake loop on the opposite side of the net.If you have a rectangular net, you will most likely have two long polls that cross each other in an X shape at the top of the net. On more elaborate nets, there may be a space for a smaller poll that holds the entryway of the net up. , Using the included stakes, or sticks if no stakes are included with the net, stake the tent to the ground by hammering the stakes into each corner of the net. There will be loops on the corner of the tent that the stakes pass through.If you're inside, you don't need to stake the net to the ground. , Keep it away from the edges of the net since mosquitoes can bite through the net if your skin is touching the edges., Make sure every zipper is closed completely.

        "text": "Some friends and I did a handmade secret santa gift exchange recently, The friend I drew from the hat has this pretty phenomenal mustache so I knew I wanted to make something to highlight that. I decided to make an embroidered portrait of him. Have another friend take a few picture of your secret santa giftee so you don't give give away that you are his secret santa. Or just take the pictures yourself, if you're not doing this for a surprise, haha. High resolution pictures taken in good lighting against light or white backgrounds work best for making the pattern. I had my friend take a few pictures and then made sure to choose the most embarrassing one. I used the \"trace\" tool in Adobe Illustrator to turn the picture into a more basic black and white picture to turn into the pattern. You could also use the \"stamp\" filter in photoshop. This is why it is good to have a well lighted picture against a light backdrop to make it easier to see what you are doing in the next step. I used my laptop as a light box so I traced the image I had made onto a piece of regular binder paper from the computer screen. I simplified it to make it easier to embroider, but it is still recognizable. I had to do a few different tracings to figure out what looked the best. I also found it helpful to tape the paper to the computer screen so it stays in place while you are tracing. Cut out a piece of fabric that is bigger than your pattern and put it an embroidery hoop. The hoop I used was 8 inches, but you might need a different size. Because this was a dark, satin-y fabric, I didn't have a way to transfer a pattern onto the fabric. The fabric was too thick to trace the pattern onto it using a light box and it melted when I tried to iron it. Since I couldn't transfer the pattern in any of the usual ways, I tacked the paper directly to the fabric. Make sure you have your pattern centered in your hoop and attach it to the fabric, using big stitches around the edge of the hoop. Make sure there are no wrinkles in the paper and the stitches holding it to the fabric don't overlap with any lines on your pattern. Cut away any paper that's hanging off the edge of your hoop, it will make things so much easier. Following the lines on your pattern, making sure to stitch through the paper and the fabric. I used two strands from a 6 strand embroidery floss and just did a simple back stitch. If you need some embroidery basics, there are a lot of other good guides out there, like this one: https://www.instructables.com/id/Embroidery-101/step5/Backstitch/ Once you have stitched over your entire pattern, take out the large stitches holding the paper to the fabric and then gently tear the paper away from the design you have stitched. Since the stitches have perforated the paper, you can tear it off pretty easily, but still be careful not to pull the stitches too much. For smaller areas you might need to use tweezers to get smaller pieces of paper out. I used satin stitch to emphasize the mustache I had outlined in the pattern. I used metallic gold thread to make it especially awesome. If you need a satin stitch tutorial, here's a good guide https://www.instructables.com/id/embroidery-how-to-satin-stitch/ I stitched outside the outline I created with the white stitches, but you can do it either way, of course, whichever you prefer. Finish your embroidery! I trimmed my fabric and gathered it with a running stitch to the back side of the embroidery hoop. And you're done! Give it to your friend!",

        "text": "There are a few ways to do this. Some people argue that the neck still needs tension and to only change one string at a time, while others say removing all of the strings is good to clean the necktake your pick. Cut them. Grab a pair of scissors and snip all six strings (or just one). By cutting off the strings, you will still have to remove the small scrap parts such as the parts around the bridge. Unwind them until they fall off. Although this way is longer, it's much safer as you won't have pieces of guitar string flying everywhere and all over your room. It's best to use a string winder as this makes the process much faster. If you don't have one, just loosen the string (like you would to tune it down) until you can slide it out of the guitar. , If you've picked up a set of acoustic guitar strings, that usually means steel strings. You want classical. Never string a classical guitar with steel strings. This will put way too much pressure on the neck, eventually causing it to bend and crack, not to mention they sound awful on a classical. Only use classical strings on your classical guitar. You can pick up some cheap ones at a local music shop or off the internet.",

        "text": "This coffee table was Born while we were searching all over for a new table for our living room. Nothing fits in form and function. So we build our own. Madeof 2 europallets. Movable on 4 heavy duty castors. The highlight is the huge storage space inside the table and the lift and the slide mechanism. On the outside, the table has many small compartments for storage. Inside is a huge storage room for games, craft, other things. You even can accommodate 3 tool boxes and stowed invisible. To open one side of the table it can be easily pushed to the side to slide it out. capacitiy in the extened state is 60kg! If the table is closed you can load more than 600kg. Here you can now work or play. Now you also have access to the stowed stuffinside the table. The other side can be easily lifted up with 2 fingers due to a hoisting mechanism supported by two gas springs. Half of the table now moves beyond 17 cm over the edge to the side and lifts up about 20 cm. Perfect height dining table in the living room for the couch. All decoration or everyday objects can remain on the table. This Coffee table is now one of the challenger in the Woodworker Contest. Would be nice if you vote for me if you like that table. Greez, Dirk You Need: Tools: Cordless Screwdriver chop saw sander planer Remove pliers or angle grinder for nails Optional: Drill with 3-4 mm drill bit for pre-drilling before screwing . Depending on how dry or brittle wood is . Material: 2 pallets and also some boards with the same thickness as the boards of the pallet . I recommend this because you have the better surface for the table top. or you need at least 3 pallets and you used the wood of the third range . 2 heavy- duty slides for the sliding mechanism. Heavy duty is recomended so you can put weight on it while it is extended . With normal drawers extracts there is a danger that if someone is put some weight on it when the plate is extended , this will break . A lifting mechanism. I took the Tavoflex from Hafele . Is similar to the one from woodworkers . Look in the comments. DIY is also possible. Look my other table. Many screws 4 heavy duty castors 1. Remove the red marked boards from pallet number one. Cut the cross running board at the red lines. Close the bottom of pallet one with some wooden boards that are left or buy some new wooden boards to close the bottom. Now you have something like a wooden box. Just the 2 open compartments on each side. Close this 8 compartments with some small wooden boards. Put 4 wheels on the four corners. Pallet number one is finished so far. 2. Disassemble pallet number two. We need 2 smal assys consisting of Number 4, 5, 6 and 9. (see attached Pic in the overview) This two assys are screwed on pallet number one. From part 10 (2 each) and 1 (2 each) we build aframe similar to the shape it got before disassemble the pallet. Now we screw this frame to the top of our construct.",

Keep your household decorations more \"spiritual\" and relevant to the holiday. Good ideas include a nativity scene, depiction of angels, and stars. Candy canes can be used to represent the shepherds that were told of Christ birth. Images of Christs life can help you reflect on him this holiday season and the green represents His love year round, not just seasonally. , Christ commonly sat with the beggars and sinners. Instead of purchasing gifts for family and friends that are hot trends, consider spending the money on gifts or donations that help them, like a Bible they can read about Christ's life, or new church clothing. Donate to charitable organizations for those less fortunate. Many families also choose to donate their time, as well as money, by volunteering in soup kitchens and homeless shelters. , Avoid music and television programs that center on the more commercialized aspects of Christmas (again, such as reindeer, Santa Claus, and so on). Unfortunately, this may prove more and more difficult as time passes. Consider purchasing your own music and movies for your personal collection. , Let them know what and why you have chosen to change your pattern.",

        "text": "Gathering fabric is really simple on a sewing machine! Much easier than doing it by hand with a running stitch, and also easier to control. I guarantee you'll know how to gather fabric in no time! :D a sewing machine a piece of fabric a ruler (if you're wanting to gather it to a certain size) You can do this on any sewing machine because all you need is a straight stitch! I am using my slightly terrible Brother than I have worked nearly to death. You will notice the tension is not quite right in the photos. At the beginning of this year it decided it didn't want to do much of anything right, especially when it involves sewing through a single sheet of fabric. ;) Set your machine to a long stitch length - anywhere from 3 to 4. Make sure you have long tails on the thread in the machine. Sew one straight line 1/8 inch from the edge of the fabric. Don't backstitch at the beginning or end and make sure to stop sewing right at the edge of the fabric so you don't get any knots. Then sew another line another 1/8 inch in from the line you just finished. Leaving long lengths (3-4 inches at least!) of thread at both ends of the fabric is vital to your success here, as well! You will want to do this from both ends - do it from only one and you'll end up pulling the strings out! You'll be using the top strings - grab both of them with your right hand and pull the fabric towards you with your left hand. You'll see it start to gather up. Do this on the other side now, and keep going until you reach the length you want. Don't worry too much about the gathers and how they're laid out, we'll fix that in a moment! Once your piece of fabric is the right size (or gathered enough!) tie both sides of it. You'll want to tie all four strings together. This will keep the gathers from coming out while you adjust it. :) After it's tied securely, feel free to cut off the ends. Now you can move the gathers around to create the look you want. Once it's all gathered properly, you'll want to sew back over the 1/4 inch stitches with a normal stitch length to secure everything. Take it slow and guide the fabric so it's straight and the gathers don't catch on the presser foot. :) This technique can be used in so many ways! Depending on how you'll be using a gathered piece, you might want to remove the initial gathering stitches or sew the securing stitches closer to the edge of the fabric - it all depends on your project. :)",

        "text": "Perhaps you're proud of your six-pack abs and want the world to see how hard you've worked to get them, but the truth is that no one respects any online dater who's half-naked in their photo. And while it's attractive to see a woman in her bikini, she will more often than not attract the wrong attention and give off the wrong vibe. So keep your clothes on and focus on your face.; , Make sure that online daters can see your face; don't sport sunglasses or a hat that shadows your features. People want to see your face; that's the whole point of why they're surfing through online dating profiles. , While it's great that you're popular, and perhaps you just think you look great in a particular picture with all your friends, your online dating photo and profile are all about you. , You're better off using a real camera to take your photos and using those. Web cam shots never do a person justice. , Opt for a more appropriate room of the house if you'd like to take a photo of yourself; I'm sure you have a mirror somewhere else in the house, too. , People want to see you and submitting more than one photo of yourself can only work in your favor. Most profiles list how many photos are in your profile, so if someone is interested in you and sees that you have 3 more photos, guess what? Click. That's what they'll do onto your profile and perhaps a wink might go alongside it. , Instead of trying to be artistic with your photos, opt instead to look straight into the camera and give your best eye contact. , The last thing you want to do is come off as angry or too serious for your own good, especially if that's not who you are at all. Don't be afraid to show some teeth and give a genuine smile in your photos. You don't have to go \"all gums\", but it would be nice to see a slight tinge of happiness in your face. , A digital camera and an honest friend will work wonders to help you get the right photos of yourself on your online dating profile.",

You can also dip apples on a stick into liquid for caramel apples. (There will be a lot!!!) Shout out to Jeanna Livingston for telling me to post this. What you will need: Ingredients: 3 cups of granulated sugar 1 cup light corn syrup 1 cup cream 1 cup (2 sticks) butter or margerine 1/8 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon vanilla extract More butter Useful Tools: 3 quart pan Candy thermometer Cookie sheet with raised edges Pizza Cutter Wax paper Spoon In your pan, combine sugar, corn syrup, cream, butter (margarine), and salt. Put in probe of candy thermometer about 1 inch from bottom. Slowly bring to a boil. Stir until sugar boils. (when sugar boils DON'T stir anymore!!!!!).Use a pastry brush dipped in water to brush the sides if any sugar starts to crystallize on the side of the pot. Gently swirl the boiling sugar througout the boiling process. Cook to hard ball stage(250F-266F) Add in vanilla. Pour immediately into buttered dish. Allow to completely cool. When cooled, cut into squares with oiled pizza cutter. (Optional: Roll into logs. They are easier to wrap.) Wrap them in wax paper. store at room temperature in a nice bowl. Enjoy",

It should include recommended portions for a lactating mother dog.It is acceptable to leave a constant supply of food out for a lactating mother and allow her to eat at will, as opposed to predetermined portions at scheduled mealtimes. , A nursing mother dog will need to eat a diet of easily digestible, high quality food that is formulated for lactating dogs. The dog food should contain at least 17 percent dietary fat, at least 29 percent protein, and less than 5 percent dietary fiber. This diet will support milk production and puppy growth, optimizing the nursing experience for all.Ask your veterinarian for dog food suggestions for your nursing dog. , If your dog is nursing a litter of puppies, it is important that she is hydrated at all times. A lactating dog will consume more water than she did while she was not nursing her puppies. It is important that she does so to prevent dehydration, which can cause problems for the mother and her puppies. Make sure you give the mother dog constant access to a large bowl filled with fresh water, and that you refill the bowl frequently.",

Ingredients and supplies for making cake pops: - A box cake mix and ingredients to make the cake - A can of frosting - Candy melts - Lollipop sticks - Cake pop stand Start by making cake balls that you will apply to sticks later to turn them into pops. Follow the directions for making your box cake mix, making one alteration. Use half the amount of vegetable oil. Let you cake cool completely and then crumble it into fine crumbs with your hands. You may want to cut off any hard edges of your cake first. Add a small amount of frosting to your crumbs and mix with your hands. Continue adding frosting until the mixture becomes the consistency of Play-Doh. Take a small amount of mixture and roll the mixture in your hands to create cake balls. Melt your candy melts in the microwave. Dip a lollipop stick into the melted coating and then into a cake ball. Set the cake pop in your cake pop stand until the chocolate hardens. Dip each cake pop into the melted coating until it is completely covered. Tap any extra coating off of the cake pop gently.Set your cake pops aside to let the coating harden or while the coating is still wet decorate your cake pops with sprinkles.

Closing your eyes will only make it more difficult to catch.; , This is vital unless you have some kind of machine that throws flying disks. , This is not entirely vital, if you and your partner(s) are careful. Windows, cars and trees are the most common hazards. ,, When the Frisbee (or aerobie) is in the air, move side to side with the movement of the disk. Do not go forward...yet. , It is instinct usually. The basic idea is to close your hands around the disk the right time and not close your eyes. If the disc is an aerobie then the easiest way to catch it is too stick you arm in the large center hole. For Frisbee the easiest way to catch is the alligator method. Take both hands and clamp them around the disc like an alligator. For a one-handed catch: Keep your thumb pointing up if the disk is coming in below your waist. If the disk is coming in high, keep your thumb pointing down. Use whichever position feels most natural for in-between heights. Squeeze your fingers and thumb tightly together to grab the disk just before it smacks into your palm. , Run straight. If it rises at the last second, it is easier to stop when going straight than diagonally , Not hard. ,",

I found scads of floppy disks in a dumpster and wanted to make plate mail armor out of it (that is my next floppy project) I found out that a bag would be a great proof of concept project. Here goes...Check out the update (2008) and my new bag: Floppy Disk Bag: Install Disk 2 Drill, hand, regular or trephine 1/8\" drill bit Pliers, I used bulldog pliers Floppy disks (CRUCIAL) Links, bits of chain from your local bead store Nails and a plank o' wood A pen Elementary math skills Eg: the ability to count NOT PICTURED The hardware for adding a strap the strap This is the matrix for my bag, feel free to make your own. Also, try to get other colors and incoperate a pattern (I just love the classic beige, black, and blue.) The horizontal is the most easy to drill because it has premarked holes. for one all you have to do is unlock the disk. Then drill a hole in the divots already in place. Insert the links and squeeze shut use your judgment as to where to place the upper and lower holes, just remember that there will be a weak link because there is a weak part of the disk, This will help you drill accurate holes in every disk (you shant need to drill all the holes for the disks that wont be attached on all sides keep this in mind How to attatch the edges. Notice that the top holes for the disk on the left are not the same as the top holes for the disk on the right (the same is true for the bottom holes) this is because I measured and eyeballed and found out where those holes will need to be so I can fasten the peices together when I fold it up depending on how you set up the bag these could be side holes or whatever... use your best judgement. Begin folding and linking at the corners when every last link in the matrix is complete Here is the bag fully formed Keys make good feet for the bag, trim out the inside and glue them on these are what will hold the straps to your bag, these are held on with nuts and bolts. you can find all the strapcessories at your local camping, military surplus or other man-store This side wil be held on by looping it through the metal dealie and securing it to itself with a metal ladder to enable adjustment of the strap Upon initial usage of this bag I got three offers to buy one and also realized that it needed some kind of interior reinforcement to make it able to bear weight easily. I suggest sealing the inside with duct or packing tape to keep problems from arising.Enjoy this newfound skill.",

After you've added the detergent, spin the center agitator of your washing machine to thoroughly mix the water and detergent together. Again, you don't want to add the mattress pad right away because it can prevent the water and detergent from fully mixing., You might use fabric softener in your other laundry, but don't add it to the washing machine with your mattress pad. The chemicals in fabric softener can eat through and destroy the vinyl backing on your pad., Once you've got the water and detergent thoroughly mixed, add your mattress pad to the washing machine. Make sure that it's fully submerged and not just floating on the top of the water. If this happens, the vinyl backing on your pad can block the fabric from reaching the water., If your mattress pad's care tag says you can dry the mattress pad in the dryer, set it to the lowest setting and add the mattress pad.

        "text": "First of all my inspiration for this project came from zjharva. This is a new version of Rocket Powered Matchbox cars with video! Now you see what they really do on rocket power! I used Hot Wheels cars but I felt they really needed to be called Matchbox because of what were about to do to them! First of all you will need a package of Estes A10-PT model rocket engines. You can find these at most Walmart store, hobby shops or other stores that carry model rockets. Something to attach the 'engines' to the cars. I used 32 gauge wire that you can wrap around the vehicle and secure the 'engine' safely during ignition. you need something to guide the car on it's track. Without this, the rocket shoots the car and rolls it, flipping and tumbling across the 'track'. I used a coffee stirrer and after cutting a small groove in the bottom of the car, cut it to size & glued it in place. This is the perfect diameter for the string that the car rides on. I picked up an Estes Race Controller that runs on 4 \"AA\" batteries and has a long enough wire with alligator clips at the end. These will attach to the rocket igniters and fire the rocket! This was wicked fun!! We brought them to a tennis court which was the perfect really flat surface and tested them out...here is the video!! Enjoy!",

        "text": "I recently saw a recipe on Crazy Adventures in Parenting for a baked egg toast with cheese. I tried it and loved it, so I've made a tutorial for you guys along with a how-to video. First, preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.Next gather up your ingredients:Sliced bread, a bit thicker than normal sandwhich bread.Cheese (i'm using a blend of four mexican cheeses, i believe)Room temperature eggs, the same number as the number of bread slices you haveA small bit of butter or vegetable oilThat's all you need! If your eggs aren't at room temperature, put them in warm but not scalding water for about 5 minutes, or they won't cook in time. Place your bread on a half sheet pan or cookie sheet.Using a spoon, create a square indentation in the middle of the bread (see picture). Use the tip of your spoon to create the edges, and the back of the spoon to push down the middle.Next, using a brush, brush on some oil around the rim of the bread. This will create good adhesion for the cheese. Sprinkle the oiled rim of the bread with cheese. Try to be careful and not get cheese on the baking sheet, because it will definitely burn.Finally, crack an egg into the middle of the bread slices. Place the cookie sheet into the middle of your 350 degree oven and bake for 8-10 minutes, or until the egg is just barely runny.In this particular recipe, I have found that the egg always comes out a bit runny. If you keep the toast on too long it will burn before the egg is completely firm. I like them runny, so this is perfect for me. After removing from the oven, season and serve your lovely baked egg cheese toast. This is a very easy meal to make, and consider how good it tastes, I will be making it very often.You can check out my YouTube channel here, I post new cooking videos every friday:www.youtube.com/c/JonathanMalott",

        "text": "Why are installing load resistors necessary for LED turn signal lights? If you don't install load resistors (also known as equalizers) with LED turn signal bulbs, you will experience the notorious hyper flash issue. Hyper flash is exactly what it sounds like, where the turn signal light flashes rapidly and is almost headache inducing. Not only is this ugly, but you may also attract the police who think your bulb is burned out. This sounds completely unnecessary and a huge hassle to boot.You will need 50W 6 OHM load resistors and tap the load resistor to the stock harness in parallel. Load resistors also have no negative or positive, making it easier for you because you wouldn't have to worry about which wires goes to which side. 1156, 3156, 7440 are single filament applications so there are only two wires (one positive, one negative). This is very straightforward as you need to simply tap the load resistor wires between the two wires. 1157, 3157, and 7443 are double filament applications which have three wires (one shared negative, one positive dim mode, and one positive brighter/blinker mode.) There is a little more trial and error involved with the wiring. We recommend you tap the load resistor between the most vivid wire color (usually the brighter/blinker) and the least wire color (usually negative). In this tutorial, we are going to try to tap the resistor the red and black wires. Test the turn after the wires are tapped. If the turn signal still hyper flashes, take the wires out and tap it to another wire and try again. The most times you will try to tap the wires is three times. We are going to assign each wire with a letter for easier reference: Red-A, Green-B, and Black-C. We originally tried A and C and tested it to see if it works. If not, try and C. If that still doesn't work, try A and B. If you have tried all three ways and the hyper flash issue is still there, then perhaps the issue causing this is the connection. Many people install load resistors with a T-tap because it sounds easy, but we definitely don't recommend this route. T-taps are sometimes unable to cut through wire and causes a loose connection or intermittent function. We recommend you directly merge the load resistor to the stock harness. Actually, my professional stereo installations have installers merge the wires instead of using T-taps. How to merge the wires: We recommend you use a wire stripper to expose the copper wire in a small slit without damaging anything. If you don't have a wire stripper, you can also scrape through the plastic using a knife or scissors. Don't forget to use electrical tape to cover it after you connect the wires. An awesome thing about merging wires is that they have a 100% success rate every time. You won't have that intermittent working/not working issue like the T-taps. Don't forget to mount the load resistor to the metal using zip-ties and not double-tape. Summary: 1. Merge wire instead of using T-taps for a perfect connection.2. Always try different wire combinations for double-filament bulbs.3. Mount the resistor to metal so you can prevent heat damage.",

        "text": "Ever get tired of carrying your poles so carefully through the brush, tall grass, or woods because they get caught on everything intheir way? Want to just keep your hands freewhen ona nice long trek to that hidden fishing hole? Well that's exactly what I thought, so I created this VERY easy carrying tube to collapse my poles and place them in the tube, and hit the trails! I use a carry bag for my tackle box, so I just remove the reels from the rods and place them in the bag with the tackle, and reassemble when ready to fish. This Instructable is so very easy, all the supplies/tools you need are: 1 - 3\" PVC Cap 1 - 3'ft PVC (thin wall) piece of pipe Hacksaw Drill (drill bits to match bolt sizes) Misc. bolts/nuts/washers The rest are items found around home, such as the strap from a duffle/shoulder type bag, and I chose to use some camo Duct tape and wrap around the pipe. 1 - Strap 1 - Duct tape (if you choose) First you will need to start with the obvious, purchasing the items shown and listed. I decided to go with 3\" thin wall PVC pipe. Purchased from local hardware store, sold by the foot. I included a cap for the bottom of the tube, and got some misc. sized bolts/washers/nuts. If you have to get a larger size piece, that's where the hacksaw will come in handy. 3'ft works best for my frame and height, and standard fishing rod lengths. Self-explanatory, the cap will be fitted onto the bottom end of the PVC tube. \"IF\" you choose to wrap the pipe in Duct tape, it may be a little tight of a fit to slide the cap over the tape. As you can see, I have mounted 2 bolts at the top of the tube. Originally this was to be a way to place a quick removable cap over the reels and the open end of the tube. At this time, (the first item I planned on using (a small foam can koozie)), ripped on me and I have not acquired an alternate yet. But the idea was the koozie would have 2 holes, and I would slide the koozie over the pipe, and stretch over the 2 bolts to hold it in place. You could also use a PVC cap as well, I have just not had a chance to purchase one or devise an alternate plan for a cap. On the left side of picture, you can also see the strap I chose to use, and I screwed it under the bolt with large washer to help hold in place. And the final product. I attached the strap (from duffel bag) on to the top and towards the bottom of the tube. After tightening the bolts at the bottom, I replaced the cap onto the tube. I felt like taking it the extra step and wrapped the tube in camo Duct tape, just for fun! (just don't lay it down in tall grass when fishing and walk away and not be able to find it!)Have used twice now. Works really well, just throw onto your back, get to your stopping place, remount the reels onto the fishing rod and you are ready to fish again!",

        "text": "Using the Nike+ system is truly awesome, but my feet don't like Nike shoes so I needed to figure out a way to put the sensor into my regular running shoes. I found some shoe pouches on Amazon, but didn't want to pay $10 for a tiny piece of neoprene that I could get myself.Before I ran to the store to get some fabric to sew together for a DIY pouch, I decided to do a super-simple hack that has ended up being my long-term solution. This has lasted me over 250 miles so far without a problem.All you need beyond the Nike+ kit is a knife and a safety pin. I don't really know how much a safety pin costs, but I'd guess 5 cents.If you're not familiar with the Nike+ system, you can check it out here:http://www.apple.com/ipod/nike/ A nice short list. - Running shoe - Nike+ kit - Knife - Safety pin Take the knife and cut a slit in the tip of the tongue on your running shoe. This only needs to be just as wide as your Nike+ sensor. The sensor goes into the tongue. There you have it. Take the safety pin and secure the sensor inside the tongue. You can be more serious and sew it inside, but I like to swap out different shoes for my runs so I use the pin. Cool, that's it! If the sensor is able to slide all the way down the inside of the tongue you want to be careful to push the sensor up to the top as you lace up, but aside from that you're ready to go. I've been using this technique for over 6 months and more than 250 miles so far and it's been pretty accurate. After calibrating the sensor at a track my records have been off by no more than 1-2% on my runs. Your results may vary.",

        "text": "Snacks around 100 calories will help wake you up a little, providing enough sustenance to combat fatigue. Anything heavier than 100 calories may make you crash after eating, so opt for healthy 100 calories snacks while driving.Sunflower seeds are often sold in 100 calorie packs and can keep you energized. Stock up on a few packs of sunflower seeds and eat them as necessary while driving. , A single cup of coffee contains about 75 milligrams of caffeine. This is enough to wake you up a little while driving, keeping you alert. Have one cup of coffee if you start to feel tired. This should give you an extra jolt that will help you keep going.Keep your eyes open for filling stations and coffee shops along the road. When you feel tired, pull over at one of these places and have a cup of coffee. Plus, you'll get to stretch your legs when not behind the wheel and you could even have a longer sleep if you wish. , This will keep your mouth busy. If you have something that occupies you, this can help you focus and stay awake. Pick up a couple of packs of chewing gum for a long trip. If you start to feel drowsy, chew some gum.Make sure to go for sugar-free gum. Sugary gum can cause a sugar crash, leaving you feeling more tired than you were before. , If you have to pull over and eat, go for small portions. Big, heavy meals can cause you to crash and become tired. Go for small portions and tiny meals when you pull over and snack on light foods throughout the drive. A number of small meals will keep you more energized than one or two big meals.For example, have half a sandwich at one stop and, when you're hungry again, pull over and eat the other half. Remember to go for energizing foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.",

Stiff felt (soft felt will do, but your bookmark will be a little harder to use)Embroidery FlossEmbroidery NeedleScissorsWater soluble penEmbroidery hoop sized for your feltTemplate (linked below Stretch your felt on the hoop. Print the template at 100% (use the 1 inch box to make sure it is sized correctly). Cut out the triangle and trace it on to your stretched felt. Draw your embroidery pattern onto the triangle. You can find a free pattern online, pay for one, or do what I did here and just freehand something. Your stitching will be small, so keep that in mind when you plan your piece. Using a variety of stitches, embroider your design. For this piece I used satin stitch for the mushroom cap, stalk and grass, french knots for the flourishes and mushroom spots, and a fern stitch for the plants on the side. You can use any combination of stitches you find appealing. Be creative! Cut out your finished embroidery piece, and a second triangle using the same template for the back. Stitch the two pieces together. I chose a blanket stitch for mine, but a running or backstitch, or even machine sewing the pieces together would work. When you've stitched everything together, run your piece under cool water to dissolve any visible ink. Let your bookmark dry completely before testing it. You don't want to wet your book pages!

        "text": "The prayer beads, also known as Mala, are used to keep track of your prayers, not as some punishment or benchmark. They are a bit like rosaries, but know that they are there to help, not hinder, your spiritual practice.Counting the beads activates your body in the prayer, allowing you to work the body (beads), mind (prayer), and spirit (visualization) at once. You can use whatever prayers or mantras you desire with your beads. Prayer beads can be found online, or purchased at many Buddhist temples or Tibetan shops. , There are, usually 108 beads on a Tibetan Prayer Bead, plus one larger \"head bead.\" Whenever you get around the mala, you're considered to have accomplished 100 prayers/mantras, with the other 8 used as spares in case you miscounted or missed a mantra. Some people believe the head bead has special significance, and it is sometimes called the \"guru bead.\" This bead is your teacher, leading you through the prayer cycle., Close your eyes and feel the first bead, often the head bead. Perform your prayer or mantra completely, then move up to the next bead, feeling your way up the mala. Some people use different mantras for the different sized beads, if you have them. You may use your right or left hand to count on. Don't worry about getting it all \"perfect.\" Focus on visualizing your prayer as you say it, staying completely in the current moment. Ground yourself in the physical world by keeping your hands on your current bead. , Once you've gone all the way around the beads, flip the chain over and keep going in the same direction you were already going. This is mostly symbolic, indicating that you would not \"step-over\" your teacher, guru, or head., There is nothing wrong with wearing your mala, keeping it with you so that you can count your prayers anywhere. If you are not carrying it, hang it somewhere out of the way or on your alter, tucked away safely.",

Try approximately three to four cloves for one head of cabbage. , The oil should cover the cabbage just enough to make it look glossy. If you don't have enough you can add more later. You want the heat to be high enough to cook the cabbage quickly, but low enough that you don't fry the cabbage. Between medium and high. , Continue cooking and stirring until the leaves start wilting. , You want just enough water to cover the bottom so that they cabbage can steam.

If you're not very flexible, you might not be able to reach parallel depth on your squat. That's fine, just go as far down as you can without injuring yourself., Your weight should be in your heels as you push up. This will keep you from tipping over forward and putting too much strain on your knees. Extend your legs until you've returned to the starting position, with arms by your sides. Exhale as you push your way up., This is the ideal range for a balance of strength building and muscle development. You might not be able to complete all the prescribed reps when you start, which is fine; just do what you can until you work your way up to 10 reps.

        "text": "The bagel. It is a wonderful food. It can be eaten at any time of day. Make a toasted bagel with butter for breakfast. Make this sandwich for lunch, and make mini pizza bagels for dinner. You can even make bagel chips to eat as snacks. This is a great lunch that doesn't take too long to make, and is very rewarding at the end. To make your delicious bagel sandwich, you will need these ingredients: Bagel, any kindYour favorite deli meat (I used barbecue chicken from Stop & Shop)Your favorite cheese (I used provolone)Jumbo romaine heartsButter (salted or unsalted, margarine, whatever butter-like substance you usually put on you bagel) Plus these tools: KnifeTin Foil For some unknown reason, I tend to buy a lot of bagels at a time. I don't eat them all that quickly, so I freeze them. You can't spread butter on a frozen bagel, so pop the halves in the oven at 350 for a minute and a half. You could also use a microwave, but I don't have one, so I couldn't tell you how long to put it in for. Grab your butter or margarine or whatever, and put an even-ish coat on both halves. Put them in the oven at 350 again, but this time for ~3 and a half minutes. Take your bagels out using a spatula, or do(n't) do like I did and grab them with your bare hands. Careful- they're hot! At this point you will want to tear off a piece of foil big enough to house your bagel halves with room to spare. You do this so the cheese doesn't burn when and if it drips off the side of your sandwich, and make your kitchen all smokey. You don't have to do this if you don't want to. Take a slice of cheese and put it on the bottom half of your bagel, right in the middle. Scrunch up three pieces of your deli meat and place them around your sandwich. Put both halves back in the oven at- you guessed it- 350 for another 3:30. After, take your sandwich out and admire it's extreme toasty deliciousness. Rip off a piece of lettuce from the top or middle of your romaine heart. You don't want to use the bottom, because it is kind of bitter. Make it just bigger than your sandwich, and place it on top. Put the top half of the bagel on, and enjoy! Try tweaking the sandwich! Put tomato on as well, or try it with tofu! I'd love to see and hear what you do in the comments!",

        "text": "hi, this is my first instructable, so if you notice some mistakes, please respond. In this instructable i will be showing you how to make a powerful, small wooden crossbow out of stuff that should not be too hard to find. Take two of your skewers and cut off the sharp tips. Tape them together about 1 cm.(0,3 inches) from the ends. Now, tie your wire to one end, bend it and tie it to the other end. Hot glue your two pieces of wood together. Glue and tape your bow on the body. For this part you are going to bring up those last two skewers. That is just what you will need for this. Cut them down to about the same length as the body (little shorter). Try to glue them close to each other without touching. Pick up your wooden clothespin and drag the bottom off. We are only going to need the part with the steel thing on. Cut off as much as you can from both sides ( but no more than i did here) ( we are doing this so we can put on the trigger). Then make a groove 6,5cm(ca.2,5 inches) from the back end and ca. 0,5 cm deep ( 0,2inches). Clip on the clothespin. Its your choice now, you can make your arrow out of almost anything. i made mine out of a skewer. You can use the rest of the arrow holder. Just put some masking tape on the back of the arrow and then cut to this > shape. Now have fun and remember to be careful. NEVER point it at anything living!!!! This is extremely powerful! it is a fun toy to bring to work or school. You can even bring it in your pocket just put your T-shirt over.

        "text": "A chemical equation is the chemical formula that provides the information of the elements and molecules that are reacting as well as the molecules that are being produced from that reaction. The Law of Conservation of Mass states that the mass of the reactants must balance the mass of the products. To balance a chemical equation, the atoms of both the elements and molecules on the reactant side (left side) and product side (right side) must be equal to each other.In this instructable, you will understand and learn how to balance a chemical equation.This instructable should take no longer than ten minutes. The unbalanced chemical equation is given to you. Aluminum reacts with oxygen to produce aluminum oxide. Rewrite the equation as shown above. First, identify the elements on the reactant side(left side) and the elements of the compound are on the product side (right side).make a list of all of the elements on each side under the equation for both the reactants and products as shown aboveUnder the reactant's side, list Al and Ounder the product's side, list Al and O An atom is the smallest component of an element that contains chemical properties of that element. The atom of each element's contains the protons, neutrons, and electrons of that element.The list made of each element on both the reactant and product side will further help you identify the number of atoms each element contains.Next to each element of the list, put the number of atoms that are in each of the elements. on the reactants side, next to Al, put 1 next to O, put 2apply these same rules to each element on the product side Notice how the number of atoms next to each element is different from the number of atoms next to that same element on the product side.In order to balance the chemical equation, you need to make sure the number of atoms of each element on the reactant side is equal to the number of atoms of each element on the product side. In order make both sides equal, you will need to multiply the number of atoms in each element until both sides are equal. As shown above, the multiplication of the atoms on the reactant side will affect both elements on the product side. After you have multiplied the number of atoms of each element until both sides are equal, you will put the number, the coefficient, of how much you multiplied the element by and place in front of that element or compound in the equation as shown above.On the product side, although both elements did not get multiplied, still place the number that was multiplied as the coefficient in front of the compound. After you have placed the coefficients in front of the molecules, make the list of elements again and check to see if multiplying the coefficient with the subscript will give you atoms equal on both the reactant and product sides.If they are not equal, rework your multiplication. After you have reworked your multiplication, make the list of elements again to check to make sure the equation is balanced. If both sides are equal, you have now balanced the chemical equation!",

I really felt like a bride in the dress that I picked out and I hope that you respect my decision.\" , Though you parents may want you to invite your second cousin by marriage twice removed, know that you do not have to. Say 'no' to them in a polite way when they try to make any unwanted additions.Go over the budget with them as well if you cannot afford additional guests. , If your family is not contributing financially to the wedding, keep the talk of it to a minimum when together. Though your wedding is an important day, it is not worth suffering unnecessary stress over. Inform them of any necessary information, like their role, the date, and time, but avoid discussing other details that you might argue over.If they try to engage with you about it, you might say something like \"You know Mom, the last time we talked about the wedding, we both got really upset. But I will say that Jess and I picked a nice venue that we're really excited about. Now can we talk about something else?\" , If you know that your mom has an eye for decoration and your dad has a lot of connections in the area, use this.

But if you're looking for a gentler introduction especially if you're not yet committed, but simply deciding whether Taoism is right for you may we humbly suggest the following? The writings of Chuang-Tzu (Zhuangzi). His writings offer a more down-to-earth and humorous perspective on the principles of Taoism. Together, Lao-Tzu and Chuang-Tzu make up the yin and yang of primary Taoist texts, and we recommend both. Zhuangzi Speaks and The Tao Speaks by Ts'ai Chih Chung. The Tao of Pooh and The Te of Piglet by Benjamin Hoff these companion books are intended for those who do not fully understand Taoism, and though they're based on Winnie the Pooh, they're easily accessible to readers of all ages.; , Many translations of Taoist texts (see below) can be found in bookstores, libraries, and the Internet. Be sure to find a quality translation of the Tao Te Ching and other Chinese texts. Since the English and Chinese languages are so different, a good translation can make all the difference. , To be consistent, begin applying the philosophical principles to your actions. , Joining a Guan can benefit you greatly and improve the pace in which you achieve peace of mind and body. Alternatively the Reform Taoist Congregation offers an online community of philosophical Taoists. , This may lead to spiritual and philosophical communion, also known as \"peace\". Even before peace is achieved, it will begin to spread outward into other people and the world around you. , Neijia (Chinese neijia), usually translated as \"internal martial arts\", follow many Taoist principles, and are sometimes called \"physical Taoism\".",

        "text": "Having to sort coins each month for my side business, I wanted a quick solution to the trouble of doing this with torn paper, and handwriting the denominations on the rolls. I searched the internet thinking that surely this must be downloadable somewhere, only to find it wasn't. Sure, you can buy these rolls ready made at an office store, but that's like a box of 5,000 boring rolls. Instead I designed my own, and made it available to the public for free at http://www.dimitrios-art.com/downloads.htmSo for those of you who do this by hand: All you do is download, print, cut, tape and save yourself some time. Click on the PDF file and print it out. Once printed, cut out on the marks. Fold the paper and cover the white space entirely and meet the line where the arrows are pointing to Now tape the edge Press the just taped coin wrap so it is nice round and start inserting the coins, look if they all fall flat on the bottom Fold the ends of the coin wrap, but first press the coins in the center of the coin wrap roll.",

        "text": "Making a ramen burger is easy, and the unusual noodle-y bun is sure to confuse and delight your taste buds; and your friends! The noodles are soft with great texture, and just like regular ramen noodles these noodle \"buns\" can be seasoned any way you like.Keizo Shimamoto created the ramen burger and shares all his ramen adventures on his blog. When he debuted the burger this year at a food fair in Brooklyn, NY people waited hours in long lineups for his original, noodle-y, twist on the classic burger. Now you can make your own ramen burger at home!All you need to make your own ramen burger buns are a pack of ramen noodles and an egg. 1 pack of ramen nooodles makes 4 \"buns\".Let's make a ramen burger! Open 1 package of ramen noodles and set included soup power aside. Place noodles into pot of boiling water, remove from heat and let soak for about 2 minutes. Strain water and let noodles cool completely, about 5-10 minutes. Once the noodles have cooled, crack an egg into the noodles and sprinkle in the soup powder. Gently mix until completely combined. To form the buns line any small round-bottomed dish with plastic food wrap. I used small disposable baking tins, but coffee cups or bowls without much taper also work well.Line the containers with plastic food wrap and scoop in a portion of noodles, then fold the plastic wrap over the noodle. I was able to stack my tins, and weighed them down with a large glass jar. The added weight from the jar will compress the noodles and help them keep a puck-like shape.Place the noodles and weight into the fridge for about 30 minutes. Set your range to high and heat up a frying pan. Add a drop of olive oil, then invert your noodle container into the frying pan. Let noodles cook for about 5-7 minutes and then carefully flip with a spatula. If your noodle puck is breaking apart allow to cook for another minute. Allow your noodles to cook the egg completely and get a nice golden brown colour.Don't worry if your first noodle bun doesn't turn out, it can take a few tries to get the buns to cook right. Practice makes perfect! The official recipe calls for green onion, arugula and soy sauce, but I went the classic bacon cheeseburger. Make your burger to suit your taste.Eating a ramen burger is an experience. The pan-fried noodle bun is crunchy on the outside, deliciously tender in the middle, and the perfect addition to any hamburger. The power soup base makes the noodles a little salty, and the beef flavour of the broth compliments my all beef hamburger patty. The texture is a little odd at first, but decidedly good. I promise you won't be disappointed with this burger. Have you made your own ramen burger? I want to see it!Happy making :)",

If there are no daughters in your family, there's no reason why another family member can't stand in as St. Lucia!, Swedish families traditionally eat lussekatter on the morning of St. Lucia Day.

Make sure you have the food and drink ready to go before you go to bed!, The person playing St. Lucia should wake up the rest of the household at dawn to wish them a happy St. Lucia Day and to serve the traditional morning snack.

        "text": "Is the problem oxidation? Or is it something else?; , Oxidation is a flat opaque covering that lays evenly on the surface of the lens, It will start out white turn yellow and eventually brown. It can build up and block all light from leaving the lens. It is semi-smooth to the touch. If your headlights are very yellowed, even a deoxidizer will not help. At that point, your headlight's UV coating is already fully damaged and the polycarbonate is exposed to the elements. It is the nature of polycarbonate to turn yellow under UV light. Sealing the surface with a non yellowing layer will prevent the polycarbonate from turning yellow. , This consists of obvious visual imperfections on the lens, such as chipping, scaring, scratching and damage caused by the use of a sandpaper type cleaning process. After market sealers are the also a problem. These sealers are generally polyurethane or acrylic based. They have no yellow stopping UV protection. Over time the heat from the bulb and the light from the sun will cause them to yellow and crack. However, UV stabilized hardened clear coat paint will not yellow and crack. There are a few other coatings that supposedly do not yellow, such as certain epoxies. Be careful what type of clear coating you buy. It might be too late for you now, but the key is to preserve the UV coating with waxes and sealants when you still have a substantial UV coating left. , Once it can be determined if the problem is oxidation or surface damage, you must next decide a method of treatment. 90% of headlights that need cleaning are afflicted with oxidation and do not need sandpaper, so don't jump to the most aggressive solution. The other 10% have actual surface damage which will need sandpaper. If surface damage is your problem stop here. There is no process that will restore your lens. They will have to be resurfaced and that will require the use of abrasives and power tools. ,",

In the example I'm using Neoprene (ordered from Sedochemicals)- An LED to show it works- Energy source. In the example I'm using 3x1.5 Volt batteries- Cables to connect Layer you materials as follows: TOP (- Optional layer or neoprene) - Stretch conductive fabric* - Ex-Static conductive fabric* - Stretch conductive fabric* (- Optional layer or neoprene) BOTTOM *VERY IMPORTANT: Layer the Stretch and the Ex-Static conductive fabric so that the layers of Stretch DO NOT touch! The layers of Stretch conductive fabric should be displaced from one another in opposite corners (so that later they can both be sewn into place without the thread ever passing through both Stretch conductive layers at one time) and sticking out slightly at opposite ends (so that later on they can be connected to a power source and electric components). Now that the layers are in place, carefully sew around the edges making sure never to stitch though both Stretch conductive layers at the same time. This step can be tricky and you can use either a sewing machine or sew it by hand as in the example. This setup demonstrates how that applying pressure to the touch pad changes the brightness of the LED. - Connect one of the (sticking out) Stretch conductive layers to the + pole of your energy source (4.5 Volt) - Connect the + pole of the LED to the other (sticking out) Stretch conductive layer - Connect the - pole of the LED to the - pole of your energy source - Apply pressure to the touch pad The amount of current changes depending on the amount of pressure to one point and the area of pressure.",

        "text": "Choose something you can move around best in. With this, you can still imply a certain character, but the last thing you want to do is have to dance in a Maxi skirt. While you want to be comfortable, make sure to follow any clothing rules that the directors mention. For example, if you are going to a ballet audition, you should wear a leotard and tights. Look professional. Even though you might have a really cute pair of dance shorts or a comfy hoodie, you should wear what is appropriate for the audition. This will make you stand out against the other dancers, and look more professional to the directors. , Go into the audition wearing Jazz shoes, Character heels, or ballet flats. You won't waste time then by having to change from your Uggs into your dance shoes. Just come with them on, even if that means you have to walk across the street in them (if you do not own any type of dance shoe, wear athletic sneakers). Make sure to choose the best pair of shoes that are appropriate for the type of dance you will be performing. , The casting director(s) don't want to see your hair flying all over the place while you dance. They want to see your face! Even if you hate to put your hair in a ponytail, it will look way better if you do. Hey, how bad do you want this? Is putting your hair up really going to stand in your way of getting a part? Doing a bun is very important for a ballet audition.",

        "text": "Here is a super easy Faux Pearl Necklace you can make for a great Mothers Day present. This is so much fun to make and so easy - just 3 ingredients that you have in your pantry. Measure out your ingredents1 cup of water1.5 cup of salt - table salt1 cup of corn starch To put the entire necklace together you will need 1 long needle and thread ( color choice is up to you). Add your water and salt and bring to a boil. I like when the salt has almost dissolved completely. Once you have a good boil turn down the heat and quickly add the cornstarch. Start to stir - then almost like magic the cornstarch will takeover the water and from a sticky paste. Keep stirring. Spoon a good size of dough out of the cooking pot and add to a mixing bowl ** remember this dough is going to be really hot so do not touch it yet. Add some more corn stach and stir away. Once the dough has cooled start to mold and shape the dough in your hands. You might have to add more cornstarch to get the right consistency you like. Now you can start to roll out the little pearls to make your necklace. You can even add some food coloring to make diffrent color pearls - so much fun. Once you have all your pearls all made out - using a good size needle poke a hole through each pearl. Let them dry for about 48 hours so they get hard. Once dried, you will be able to use needle and thread and sew you pearls together to make your necklace and or bracelet. Have fun with making all kinds of jewelry - this clay can be molded to make almost anything - and it is so easy to make. Here I string them both and added some silver chain and claps to the end to give a more fancy look.Thanks and have fun!http://www.tissupapers.blogspot.com",

        "text": "It's just awful that when I open my refrigerator, all the cold air falls out. This makes me sad. So, I turned my refrigerators word upside down, or at least 90 degrees. Now, when I open the door, more cold air stays inside and this makes me happy - it increases my quality of life in fact. For the rest of you with a large refrigerator.... I, and my partner in crime have something cooking for you. But, it's going to take a month or so as I want data showing this big refrigerator modification works. As you read meters are whizzing and collecting :) This particular model was discovered in the annals of the UCF dumpsters during dorm move-out. The funny thing is, it was found, in the dumpster, with ice inside. To speed up production time, the compressor is assembled on a compressor mount separately from the rest of the unit. So, unscrew the compressor assembly from the fridge. Firmly grasp the compressor and rotate it 90 degrees so that the top of the compressor faces what will become the bottom of the refrigerator. Try not to move it too much to prevent damage to the lines coming in and out the compressor. Please note, it will take a fair amount of force to rotate the compressor assembly. This is normal. If your refrigerator is designed like mine, the compressor assembly will not fit back into the space provided by the fridge manufacturer. I scrounged up 4 1/2 inch PVC couplings to act as spacers. I'm also using a spare bit of 1/2\" PVC pipe and two 90 degree elbows to make feet. I used 5 minute epoxy ($1 from harbor freight) to secure the feet and coupling risers. And by upright I mean on it's back - the new bottom :) Before turning on, you'll probably want to let the compressor sit upright for a few hours, to make sure any oil settles back at the base. I'm not quite sure this is completely necessary as I believe the lubrication is in the refrigerant itself, but perhaps its best to play on the side of caution. Now, plug your chest refrigerator in and turn it on :) For those wanting to turn a refrigerator into a freezer, it shouldn't be too hard. The only thing you'll need is a new thermostat that is connected to your compressor. As mine will be used, for now, as the beer fridge with spirits locker - I will not be converting to a freezer.",

        "text": "Fried oreos are a state fair special. The ones at the Kentucky State Fair are especially good. I know because I have eaten lots of them. :D Fried oreos are also a fun dinner party dessert because they're so easy to make at home. This might be a bad thing to share with the internets, and I might be contributing to the rise of obesity, but good lord they're good. As my boyfriend said: \"It's like a pancake and an oreo had a delicious baby!\" He ate six fried oreos. This, my friends, is a man who knows what he's talking about. double stuffed oreos (If you're gonna do it might as well go all out!) 1 1/4 cup pancake mix (I used Krusteaz buttermilk) 1 tablespoon canola/veggie oil 1 cup milk pinch of salt 1 egg You'll also need a pot filled with canola/veg oil heated to 350 F. I used a probe thermometer to make sure my temp was staying where it needed to be! :D Put the pot of oil on the stove over medium heat. In one bowl, mix together the milk, egg and oil. Mix it really well - you shouldn't have any bits of egg floating around. Add a pinch of salt to the pancake mix, and then pour in the milk mixture. Combine these two with a whisk until you're nearly clump free. :D Depending on your pancake mix, you mix have a runny batter right now. We'll do a test fry to see how things are going. :D As you can see, the fried oreos on the left are looking a little sad. The batter for these was just too thin. I originally started out with a 1:1 ratio of pancake mix and milk and it just wasn't working. Adding another 1/4 cup of pancake mix made it perfect. So if your batter is too thin, just add mix little by little (1/4 cup at a time) until it's thick enough to cover the oreo well! Before you start, double check that the oil has reached 350 F. If it's there, turn down the heat just a bit so the oil doesn't keep going up in temp. Dip the oreos into the batter and toss them around to coat well. Don't leave them in here too long - just do a few at a time. If you let them hang out too long they'll get too soft. Lower them gently into the hot oil and fry them, turning them over and moving them around for a couple minutes. Each batch should take no more than 2-3 minutes to get nice and golden brown. When they're golden brown, pull them out and let them rest on a plate covered in paper towels. :D You can eat them as-is, on ice cream, covered in powdered sugar - whatever you like. :D Just know that they aren't so good once they've been cool for a while - it's best to eat them when they're hot and gooey.",

Getting a few more hours of sleep will have you feeling better in no time. , Hangovers cause hypersensitivity to light and noise. Wear sunglasses if you are leaving the house, and avoid listening to loud music. If you are having trouble getting out of bed or are continuing to vomit, consider calling in sick to work or school. While you wouldn't want to make this a habit, you are probably not going to be of much use at work if you are constantly running to the bathroom. , The endorphins released during exercise can help improve your mood, which is important if you are feeling anxious as a result of being hungover. Exercise also speeds up the the process of metabolizing the alcohol, helping it leave your system faster. Be sure to properly hydrate both before and after exercising to prevent further fluid loss. , Beating yourself up for having a hangover will only make you feel worse. Giving yourself time to rest and recover is the only way to make it go away, so take advantage of your \"free\" day by catching up on your favorite shows, watching a new movie, or reading a book.

To me, working with pallets takes a good amount of work but I do like the feeling of up-cycling something that would have gone to the landfill. Drawing File Plan 1https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B21TbB8gGNQbMEl2... Drawing File Plan 2https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B21TbB8gGNQbUWUw... Find free pallets from Craigslist. If not available, you can purchase them locally for very little money. When searching through the pallet stack, look for the pallets with the most usable wood. The length of the slats is ~ 3 feet. The thickness varies from to thick. The width of the slats can vary from 2.5 to 6 inches. Breaking the pallets apart takes a decent amount of work. Use a jig or circular saw to cut the ends. Pry the wood from the center support. This should give you 8 to 14 boards per pallet. Remove nails from slats. Before you start cutting, determine the best pieces to get the desired width (see drawing). I had multiple long pieces with cracks and/or damage down one side. I was able to cut the damage off and still have usable pieces. Refer to the drawings in the intro for the length of each board. After cutting the pieces, sand them with course sandpaper to remove rough spots or major staining/paintunless that is your desired look. Assemble top frame (nail & glue) Assemble bottom platform (nail & glue). Ready for next step Attach the sides to the top frame and bottom platform (nail & glue). Attach the side trim to the upper sides (nail & glue). Attach the top trim (nail & glue). Sand again Finish as desired.

        "text": "It's possible that the number you have at hand is not correct. Phone numbers from Bolivia are composed of 7 numbers and the first digit must be a number between 2 and 8. Note that this is the local number without the region or country code.; , Bolivia has 9 departments (administrative divisions): Sucre, La Paz, Santa Cruz, Cochabamba, Beni, Tarija, Oruro, Potosi, and Pando. Ask the person which department you'll call to make it easier to know the region code. , Chuquisaca (Sucre) 64xxxxx Cobija (Pando) 842xxxx Cochabamba 4xxxxxx La Paz 2xxxxxx Oruro 52xxxxx Potosi 62xxxxx Santa Cruz 3xxxxxx Tarija 66xxxxx Trinidad (Beni) 46xxxxx , There are only three regions in Bolivia and each region corresponds to three departments. The codes are as follows: La Paz, Oruro, Potosi: 2 Santa Cruz, Benia, Pando: 3 Cochabamba, Sucre, Tarija: 4 , The code for Bolivia is 591. You will have to dial 011 for international calls, then the region code (2, 3, or 4) according to the list and then the city code. For example, to call Cochabamba the number would be 011-591-4-4xxxxxx , If you are calling with a card or by automated operator services, you won't need this step. The long-distance operator number is a number of one or two digits that identify each of the long-distance telephone companies. Select the carrier of your choice and get their number. , The result will be 011 - yy 591 - r - xxxxxxx, where yy is the external operator number, r the region code, and xxxxxxx the number of the place you want to call. , For this, you simply need to introduce the preceding number without the long distance carrier code. , The region code is 7. A 7-digit cell phone number may begin with 9. If using an automatic operator, dial 011-591-7-xxxxxxx.",

        "text": "Construct your own miniature siege engines! 1. A couple of nasty looking boards. 2. A 1/2\" diameter dowel. 3. A short piece of a 2x2. 4. A length of thin rope. 5. Two 1\" wood screws. 6. A 1/2\" drill bit. 7. A 3/4\" spade bit. 8. A drill or drill press. 9. A table saw or circular saw or handsaw. 10. A miter saw or miter box or motorized miter box 11. Scissors. 12. A screwdriver 13. A lighter. 14. A pencil. 15. A roll of tape. 16. A ruler. 17. A miniature enemy. First, use your table saw to cut your nasty looking boards into two 7 1/2\" x 3 1/2\" rectangles. Once you've done this, tape the two boards together with the broad sides touching, then, with your pencil, mark the two longer edges: \"top\" and \"bottom\", and the two shorter edges \"front\" and \"back\". Measure 1\" up from the \"bottom\" and 2\" from the \"front\" and draw an X. Next, measure 1\" down from the \"top\" and 3\" from the \"front\" and draw another X. Next, with your boards still taped together, measure 1/2\" up from the \"bottom\" and 1/2\" from the \"back\" of the board and draw a V. Flip your taped boards over and draw another V in exactly the same place on the other side. Last, measure 3 1/2\" from the \"front\" and 1 1/2\" from the \"bottom\" and draw a T. Do the same on the other side. Fit your 1/2\" bit into your drill. Drill the Xs all the way through. Drill the Vs to a 1/4\" depth. Drive a screw into each of the Ts so about 1/4\" sticks out. Separate the two boards. They should look like a mirror image of each other. Next, use your miter saw to cut your dowel into two 5 1/4\" lengths and one 4 1/4\" length. Cut your 2x2 to a 7\" length. Cut one end into a triangle shape. With your 3/4\" bit, drilla 1/4\" deep hole on the end opposite, and the side perpendicular to the triangular end. Drill a 1/2\" hole toward the triangular end. Then use your scissors to cut a 26\" piece from your length of rope. If you're using braided nylon or another synthetic like I am, you'll have to use your lighter to melt the ends so they don't fray. Now that you have all your parts, you can start to assemble your catapult. Start by tying a knot in each end of your 26\" piece of rope. I prefer to use a knot called a double half hitch for this. Then attach it to the screws. Next, pass one of your longer dowels through the smaller hole of your catapult arm. Fit each end into the lower holes on the sides. This dowel will be a pivot for the arm. Use the catapult arm to twist the rope around the dowel as shown. There should be a fair amount of tension. Slip your other longer dowel into the upper holes in front of the arm to maintain the tension in the rope. Finally, notch the shorter dowel into the shallow holes you drilled toward the back, and you're done. You now have a functioning mechanism with which to wage minuscule siege warfare! Don't stop there though. Embellish! For more home-made wackiness, check out Pariahcycle.Blogspot.com",

ToolsSoldering ironHot glue gunKnife/razorWire cutterComponentsSolderHot glueOne-sided copper PCBConductive foamWireThe foamConductive foam is what microcontrollers generally come packaged in. If you've received little ATmega microcontrollers or PICs, sometimes they'll be surrounded by conductive foam inside a little case or box. Not all conductive foam is created equal: some of it bounces back into shape faster than others. If you use PIC foam to make your FSR, it will respond quickly, but if you use ATmega foam will take a second to release. The fact that this FSR has a visible deformation is the primary difference from other FSRs. Use the knife/razor to score your PCB into two plates that mirror each other. I went with approximately one-square-inch squares, but you could do any two shapes so long as there is copper in between. Cut your foam into the same shape as the plate. Solder one wire to each plate. You'll want to make sure the solder is going to hold the wire in place, so clean the copper beforehand if necessary and use plenty of solder. Glue the three pieces together. Only glue along the outline of the FSR, otherwise it will not conduct well. For mine, I just glued the top and bottom of both plates to the foam. Grab a multimeter and measure the resistance across your FSR. Your values will vary, but I got about 200 kiloohms at rest and 9 kiloohms when almost completely depressed. If your plates have a larger surface area, or the foam in between is thinner, these values will be smaller. VariationsUse it to Dim an LED (video + code)Use it to Make some noise (video)Try different kinds of foam (test resistance across the foam first to make sure it's conductive)Cut unusual shapesTest different foam configurations (e.g.: multi-layered foam)Test different plate materials (e.g.: aluminum foil on cardboard/plastic/wood)Make humongous FSR arraysLinksSensorWiki FSR page explains FSR theory and use, with examplesProtolab explanation of FSR use in the context of other sensorsThanks to Dane Kouttron and Zach Barth for introducing this technique to me, and leaving a few FSRs around the eclub.",

There are two base templates included, one for iPhone 4S and one for Samsung Galaxy S2 and S4. It should be easy to adapt the kit to suit most phones. It is simply a matter of ensuring that the loudspeaker on the phone is positioned over the horn inlet hole. This model was originally published on robives.com a website full of paper animations to download and make. NEW: Base for Galaxy S3, free download. You can follow Rob Ives on twitter @robivesand facebook atrobivescom The model works well printed onto coloured card. (230 micron / 67lb) I used a selection of colours from these cards I bought from a local stationer. Print out the horn parts sheet (page two) twice on complementary colours. Print out page three on another colour and then either page four or five depending on whether you are making the iPhone or Galaxy version. The final page is the project label and should be printed onto white paper. Score along all the dotted and dashed lines before carefully cutting out the parts. Fold round and glue down the wide ends of the horn pieces to make triangular tubes. These keep the end of the horn rigid. Glue together two of the horn pieces with tabs on the end. Line up the parts as accurately as possible. Glue the next two pieces into place this time using two pieces without tabs. Alternate two with tabs the two without for the remaining horn pieces. Roll round and glue the end into a circle. Work your way along the horn gluing one row at a time... ...right up to the end of the horn. Glue together the four sided end pipe. Glue the end pipe to the horn. Assemble the two main base pieces as shown. Glue together the two cross pieces. Fold round and glue up the triangular shaped lower front. Fold up and glue the horn holder.Fold the end of the horn holder into place and glue it down. Notice the small hole. this will line up with the loudspeaker on the iphone. Glue the five parts of the base together. Keep everything as square as possible so that the base sits properly on a flat surface. Glue the horn holder to the base as shown. Complete the model by fitting the horn. there is no need to glue it into place. Place your iPhone on the stand with the loudspeaker lined up with the hole in the horn holder and be amazed at the incredible sound quality! Assemble the two main base parts as shown with the tabs folding in as shown. Fold up and glue together the horn holder. The picture shows the version with the Galaxy S4 hole cut out. Assemble the two back cross pieces. Fit the horn holder into place using the grey areas for alignment. Glue the two back cross pieces into place. Make sure that everything is square so that the base sits properly on a flat surface. Fold up and glue together the base front. Glue the base front into place as shown. Complete the model by fitting the horn. There is no need to glue it into place.

        "text": "Precious metals are stamped with a hallmark, a symbol or series of symbols that denote its type, purity, and authenticity. If your item contains a sterling silver hallmark, it is sterling silver; if it does not have one of these markings, it is more than likely a silver plated piece.Use a magnifying glass to search for hallmarks in discreet locations. The United Kingdom, France, and the United States of America each have a distinct hallmarking system. American sterling silver is marked with one of the following hallmarks: \"925,\" \".925,\" or \"S925.\" the 925 indicates that the piece contains 92.5% silver and 7.5% other metals.Sterling silver items made in the UK contain a stamp of a lion. In addition to this stamp, UK made items will also contain a town mark, a duty mark, a date letter, and a sponsor's mark. These marks will vary from item to item.France currently marks its sterling silver items with the head of Minerva (92.5% and below) or a vase (99.9% pure silver).; , When sterling silver is gently tapped, it will produce a high-pitched bell-like tone that lasts for 1 to 2 seconds. To conduct this test, carefully tap the sterling silver item with your finger or a metal coin. If the item is truly sterling silver, it will generate a high-pitch ring. If you do not hear a ring, the item is not sterling silver. When you tap the item, use extreme caution so you do not ding or dent it., Silver does not produce a smell. Hold the item up to your nose and smell it carefully for a few moments. If you sense a strong smell, the item the item likely contains too much copper to be sterling silver.Copper is a common alloy in sterling silver, but 925 sterling does not contain enough to make a smell., Silver is a soft, bendable metal. To determine if the item is silver, you can attempt to bend the item with your hands. If it bends easily, the item is probably made from pure silver or sterling silver. If the item does not bend, it is less likely that it is made from silver or sterling silver.",

        "text": "Try to use as much detail as you can when you compliment your boyfriend. Specificity will make your compliments feel more personal and specific to him rather than something that you could say to anyone.Telling your boyfriend he has nice eyes is fine, but it is not as special as telling him his beautiful blue eyes remind you of the lake you grew up on. , Some compliments, such as \"You have a nice smile,\" are very common. This doesn't mean they can't be true of your boyfriend, but the best compliments are usually ones the person you're complimenting hasn't heard before. An original twist makes the compliment seem more unique and special.Rather than, \"You have a nice smile,\" you might say, \"I love the dimple on your right cheek when you smile.\" , Paying a compliment you don't mean can immediately come off as false and insincere. If you don't want to pay your boyfriend a compliment about something, it's best not to. A fake compliment just doesn't sound quite right to the listener. On the other hand, if you mean what you're saying, your boyfriend will appreciate the sentiment, even if you're nervous and the words don't come out right.Try not to get hung up on complimenting your boyfriend with just the right words. The sentiment of what you're saying matters most. , Complimenting your boyfriend by putting down someone else, especially if he cares about them, can backfire. It can also cause jealousy to compare your boyfriend, even favorably, to ex-boyfriends or other guys you have dated before. Try not to compare your boyfriend to others with your compliment. Complimenting him should be about him and make him feel good.",

        "text": "I can't even begin to tell you how many needles I've broken while trying to hem jeans. At one point I was going to don safety glasses to protect my eyes from flying needles! But no more! I thought there has to be a better way and today I will show you just what I do. I consider this my 12 Step Program to Hemming Jeans. Start out by measuring from the inner crotch to how many inches long the legs need to be. My husband has short legs and needs his pants to be 27 inches. I need one inch to fold up so I mark 28 inches with a Sharpie. Mark straight across with a ruler. Cut and save the piece. Use it to measure the second leg, mark and cut it. If the only reason I bought my serger was to hem jeans then it was money well spent! Serge all the way around, just barely trimming. Yes I know it's white thread, and I know I should change it to blue, but I hate changing it and besides who's going to see the inside of Hubby's pants? If you don't have a serger I'm sure you could do a zig-zag stitch using your sewing machine. We just want to stop the fray. Remember that extra inch when you measured? Fold the jeans up one inch and pin. Pin all the way around. Make sure everything lays flat. Use your sewing machine, and with blue thread, stitch all the way around. I like to follow the serger line. Iron everything flat. This step is purely optional but it will look more professional if you do it. Change your thread to gold and, using your sewing machine, sew around about a 1/2 inch from the edge. Because the hem is only doubled over you can even backstitch over the seams, something I could never do if I had them folded up twice without risking a broken/bent/flying needle. Finished. After a few washes the hem looks even more authentic, and if you're impatient you can rub sandpaper or a nail file over the hem for that original look. I'm sure there are a zillion different ways to hem jeans but this is what works for me. I hope you enjoyed the tutorial :)",

        "text": "Symptoms and signs of canine stroke will vary from those noted in humans. People suffering from a stroke may have signs of total paralysis on one side of the body that is affected or seen with a drooping face.In dogs, rather than the drooping face, you may notice a tilting or turning head, imbalance that leads to falling or circling, an inability to walk or keep his balance and often times, a loss of vision. Your veterinarian will perform some specific tests to determine if the symptoms indeed signify a stroke. , Your veterinarian will first determine your dog's condition by the signs you have related to him or her, along with physically watching your pet's behavior and walk. Tests for a definitive diagnosis involve such tests as an MRI, CT scan and standard X-rays in order to see specific images within the brain. Your dog may need to be anaesthetized for these and other tests such as a spinal tap that takes a sample of spinal fluid in an effort to check for other issues, concerns and diseases with similar symptoms. The doctor will be looking for any type of tumor on the brain, bleeding and its source or inflammation and infection. , Canine strokes occur when the blood supply to the dog's brain is blocked or lessened so that proper function is inhibited. If a blood vessel bursts within the brain, it leads to a hemorrhagic stroke, while an Ischemic stroke is due to a reduced blood supply to the brain.The brain cannot function properly without a constant healthy supply of blood that provides necessary nutrients and ample oxygen throughout the body. When proper blood supply and circulation is compromised, altered bodily function can be evident.",

Of doubtful origin, this fermented tea has a passionate following who claim all manner of health benefits for it. I just like it because it tastes good. You can buy the yeasty starter on the web (sometimes misidentified as a mushroom), or get it from a friend. You might also try looking on message boards of health food stores.The starter replicates itself in each batch, so one is enough for your lifetime. Soon you'll have enough for everyone you know! Add two to five tea bags (black or green) to three quarts of water. Let it steep for 8-24 hours, depending on how black you like it. Add 1 cup of sugar to the water (the starter feeds on sugar, so the final drink will not be as sweet as the original). Like I said, stir well until all the sugar is dissolved. Add the starter to your tea, along with any remaining liquid from the last batch of kombucha. Cover with a clean tea or paper towel and seal around the rim with a rubber band. Store in a spot out of direct sunlight for 7-14 days (depending on who you talk to). When its time is up, start all over again! Your starter will have grown another layer, which you can peel off and use for a second batch (or give to someone else).",

        "text": "Hi Guys :) Please rate this Instructable and follow me if you liked it. Thank you. :) Here is a Simple Way to Build a Trebuchet. A trebuchet is a siege engine that was used in the Middle Ages to fling projectile ofup to140 pounds at enemy structures.Please Rate this Instructable and follow me for more cool step by step guides. Made By Manish Kumar What you need: 1. Popsicle sticks 2. Super Glue 3. Double-Sided Tape 4. Electrical Tape 5. Sharp Scissors or a Knife 6. Round Pencils (as an axle) 7. Washers 8. Any sort of counterweight. (I used coins See step 10 on how to make a counter weight) 9. Any sort of Projectile (I used polo :P) 10. Eye Hooks Step 1: Build the base of the trebuchet using Popsicle sticks and stick them to each other using super glue as shown. Step 2: Fortify the base from the other side by sticking more Popsicle sticks. First line the top and the bottom edge with a popsicle stick each. Glue them firmly and wait till they dry. Then Do the same for the right and left sides. Repeat this layering until you have two layers. This will give the structure a firm base. Step 3: Create a structure as shown below. Do this by using a Popsicle stick and placing two other sticks at an angle on either side of this stick, then place another popsicle stick over it to fortify the pillar. Step 4: Repeat Step 3 and create a similar structure. These will act as pillars or columns to support the upper body (the axle) of the trebuchet. Step 5: First use super glue to join the pillars to the base. And let it dry for a while to strengthen the structure. Then use washers and place them between the two pillars. One must make sure that the holes in the washers are big enough for the pencil to fit through. Use another Popsicle stick to fortify the two pillars together. Use double sided tape if necessary. Step 6: Insert the pencil through the washer hole on one side and out of the other hole. Use electrical tape and tie it on either side of the pencil so that the pencil cannot come out of the washer. Make sure that the tape is wounded several times across the pencil until it makes a stack wide enough to prevent the pencil from slipping out of any edge. Step 7: Create a structure as shown. This will act as the throwing arm of the trebuchet. Use your scissors to add small pieces of wood from the Popsicle stick to fortify the throwing arm. Create a small cradle like structure and attach it to one end of the arm. This will hold your projectile. Secure it using super glue. Then attach a popsicle stick across the two sticks fanning out so as to join them. Punch a hole in this stick Step 8: Attach the throwing arm using super glue. Step 9: Attach a posicle stick across the two sticks fanning out. Punch a hole in this stick halfway through. It will act as a counter weight carrier. Step 10: Make a counter weight by inserting heavy metal pieces/ stones (I used coins) in a plastic zip loc bag. Close the zip loc and punch a hole on top. Step 11: Insert one end of the eye hook into the hole punched in the throwing arm, the other side should be inserted in the hole in the zip loc bag. Place a projectile in the box and FIRE AWAY!! http://issuu.com/howtowithmanish/docs/how_to_the_trebuchet",

        "text": "Start at home with older brothers and sisters, then ask grandparents, aunts and uncles, cousins, friends, and so forth. Specific requests, asked nicely, can sometimes yield great results. You may be doing them a favor--sometimes people have quite a stash of items that are too good to get rid of, but also do not want to just throw out. Also consider people who have access to get items inexpensively. Maybe your cousin who works at a store has a 20% employee discount, and would be happy to help you get a great price on items there. , Check your local Freecycle.org website for items people are giving away for free. You can also make requests, if necessary. Craigslist.org is also a site in which people in a local area sell items (typically inexpensively) or even for free. Also check websites which are community-based. For instance, in Vermont, USA there is frontporchforum.com, which has bulletin postings based on one's town. , Paper, envelopes, 3-ring binders, folders, and more can be re-used without having to buy new. Warning: never take stationery or other office supplies from work without asking, though, or you could lose your job for stealing. Usually offices are happy to no have to throw away office supplies, and may even qualify for a tax write-off. , Businesses will often have free notepads, pens, pencils, sticky notes, and water bottles at various events or in-store. Although you are unlikely to get \"big ticket\" items this way, these items are free!",

Look them over and choose the one that you believe will be easiest for you to use. The results should be the same, no matter which conversion calculator you choose. Select one that is easy for entering data with easy-to-read results., When you find an online conversion calculator that you like, it should have a box or space for you to enter your initial measurement of nanometers. You do not need to worry about counting decimal places or knowing conversion factors. Just enter your measurement, and your answer should appear., On some conversion calculators, after you enter your initial measurement, you need to press a \"convert\" button. On others, the result may be automatic.For example, at the conversion site www.Metric-conversion.net, as soon as you enter the number of nanometers in the first box, an equivalent number of meters will appear immediately in the second box. Entering the number 2,600 in the first box will cause the value of <PHONE> m to appear in the second box.",

Wait for the water to come to a boil. , If you want to have a more traditional tea, you can use an authentic Thai tea blend. It would be a good idea to check the ingredients, however, as some Thai tea blends contain yellow or orange dyes to give the tea that traditional orange color. Unfortunately, not all of these dyes are organic., Stir the tea with a long spoon or whisk until the sugar dissolves, then give it a taste. If it is not sweet enough for you, add some more maple syrup or sugar. If you can't find any maple syrup, try agave nectar instead. If you can't find any muscovado sugar, try organic brown sugar or coconut sugar instead. If you are using an authentic Thai tea blend, you can skip the vanilla extract and maple syrup as it will have other flavors in it. , Once the tea is cold, fill your glass with ice. Pour the tea into the glass until it is three-quarters of the way full., If you do not have any coconut milk, or if you don't like it, you can use another type of non-dairy milk.

        "text": "Be quick on your feet to respond, especially if you are nervous as your other friends will tell everyone if you admit your feelings. Be ready to change the subject or divert the focus from you if the sensitive topic arises. When questioned about your feelings you have to have a determined-sounding response and fire back your response without too much (or too little) delay. One of the biggest tell-tale signs of someone who is hiding their feelings is that they become uncharacteristically quiet or standoffish. If you want to hide your feelings, you have to hide the fact that you're hiding them as well! So be sure to try not to come across as overly quiet., If they ask you directly, and you still don't want to admit, you're going to have to consciousness look them in the eye and lie. Make your response simple and to the point. Many people believe that making eye contact is a sign that the speaker is telling the truth so this along with your brief responses will help to keep your feelings secret. , If you are overcome with anger or sadness and those feelings intensify in the presence of others, you may have to take some time out and avoid the people who stir those feelings in you. In many cases, time will help alleviate some of your emotions, and you will be able to resume your relationship once things have cooled down. In some cases, such as instances of extreme betrayal or abuse, it might be better to eliminate that relationship altogether.",

Your reader should have enough information from the caption, the key, and the graph to be able to make sense of it without reading your paper. , Unless you are writing a humorous paper that includes humorous graphics, generally captions are better left serious due to the need for conciseness. , That is, it should be no longer than a paragraph, but really, a sentence should be sufficient, at most. In fact, captions don't even need to be complete sentences. For a photograph, it's okay to make it shorter than a sentence, such as \"Kayley on the Ferris wheel.\" , For instance, the above caption could have said \"Kayley waves her hand on the giant green Ferris wheel,\" but the extra information that provides isn't necessary for the reader to understand what's going on in the picture. , How you do this depends on the style guidelines you are using.

Kids in school often switch roles back and forth between bully and victim. Don't keep the cycle going. Make sure you're setting a good example and not being a bully, regardless of whether or not people think of you as popular. , If you see someone getting excluded or bullied, reach out and defend them. Sit next to people at lunch who have no one else to sit with, and befriend those who feel like no one wants to be their friend. It's true that there's safety in numbers, but even more importantly, you'll make someone feel better about themselves. In turn, that'll help your self-esteem, too. Remember that the tables could always turn: you might see someone get targeted one day, and find yourself to be the target the next. Defend someone the way you'd want to be defended. , Mean, annoying populars bully others because they think that's what makes them popular. A lot of the time, they end up being right: studies show that the more popular you are, the more likely you are to bully.You can't change your school's social dynamics overnight, but you can become part of the solution by helping to change people's perceptions. Work on being a positive example for others, including the bullies. Be the change you want to see. Remember, kids are a lot more likely to be influenced by their peers than by authority figures.Understand that people often bully because they have insecurities, need a sense of control, or countless other complex reasons.

Rather than turning help or support down, accept it, and let other people help you if they offer.If you isolate yourself after a loss, the loss will only feel worse, and have a larger impact on you. Instead, surround yourself with people and things you love. , Mental health can have an impact on physical health. If you let yourself move into an unhealthy place emotionally, it can circle around and have an effect on your physical well-being. Fortunately, taking care of yourself physically has positive effects on your mental health. Exercising and eating well can be positive steps to take.Try to get outside for a little while each day. Go for a walk, ride a bike, or take a jog. You could even try opening the windows in your house to get a bit of fresh air. , Pushing negative feelings away and not allowing yourself to feel them won't really solve the problem. If you need to cry, you should let yourself cry. Or, if you feel angry, it's okay to tell someone you're angry. Also, if you're feeling like you're getting over things and feeling better, you don't need to feel guilty for that, either.If you push feelings away and refuse to feel them, you might find that you're stuck in the grieving process even longer than you needed to be. Feel what you need to feel. Try writing in a journal to express your feelings. This will help you collect your thoughts in one place and be able to look back on them if you need to. , Loss, in whatever form it takes, can take a toll on you emotionally. Counseling and therapy are great, constructive options if you find yourself struggling through your feelings. If you are feeling especially depressed, or if you notice any changes in your normal lifestyle, like a lack of appetite or loss of interest in things you like to do, seek help. These could be signs of mental health issues that need to be addressed.",

        "title": "How to Make a Coin Ring From a Quarter",
        "text": "In this Instructable I will show how I was able to make a ring from a regular US quarter. I have done a previous Instructable making a silver spoon into a ring as well. This process could work with a steel washer but takes a significant amount more time as a regular quarter is made from copper and nickel. I didn't come up with the idea of making rings from coins, this is just my take on the process. Aside: It is fine to use a US quarter to make jewelry, what you cannot do is alter us currency and pass it off as another denomination. The tools I used are:Drill and Drill BitsStep Drill BitCenter PunchRing Mandrel Blow TorchPliersNylon HammerPlastic PipeSandpaper of various gritsRound FileSharpieDigital CaliperPolishing Compound for MetalOptional:Doming BlockDremel and Polishing Tools Here is a video of the the whole process. The written instructions will follow. I'm using a quarter and I marked the center of the coin with a sharpie after measuring with a digital caliper. Then I center punched the coin so the drill bit would not skate when drilling the pilot hole. To make drilling the center hole easier I took two pieces of aluminum bar stock and using a small Dremel cutting wheel I notched out a spot so the coin could be clamped in a vice without damaging the embossing of the coin. Then I drilled out the hole using a step drill bit and cleaned up the hole with a round file. Another option is to use a metal punch to punch a hole in the coin. I don't have one so I am using a step drill bit instead. Next to make the coin easier to work and to relieve any stresses you need to annealed the coin by heating it up and quenching in water. This does not harden the coin, that only applies to ferrous metals that have a high carbon content. Place your \"washer\" coin on your ring mandrel and start tapping it with a nylon hammer. You want to use quick and firm but not overly hard taps. Work slowly and move the mandrel around while tapping. You can also work the coin against a piece of wood while tapping to help keep the coin on the mandrel. Slowly the coin will start bending down around the mandrel.Using a piece of plastic pipe you can smack the coin down around the mandrel to help speed up the process.If the coin becomes hard to work with, anneal it every so often.Eventually you will want to flip the coin around and start working it on mandrel facing upwards. See the pics.It will start looking like a ring.You work the ring down on the mandrel with the plastic pipe to the size you need. An optional step is to use a doming block to round the edges of the ring. You put the ring in the doming block and apply pressure in a vise. You will want to make the ring one size larger than the final size., as the doming block will make the ring smaller. Take your time with this step as if the ring is not centered it can make the rounding of the edge unequal, ruining all your hard work.If you need to adjust the ring size you can use the ring mandrel to make the ring larger.Lightly sand the ring to take off any sharp edges. Using some metal polish and Dremel with a polishing wheel, polish the ring until it shines. Repeat as many times as needed.You can also polish by hand if you don't have a Dremel, or use a drill with a buffing wheel.",

        "text": "The easiest method to generate leads is to hire a company that specializes in lead generation. These companies offer a variety of different leads, such as: Live Transfers-Leads are transferred directly to your phone. The lead generation company gets in contact with mortgage leads. Once the lead is determined to be of high-quality, they are transferred, live, right to your phone. Direct Mail- Lead generation companies run mortgage direct mail campaigns. The responses from direct mail pieces become direct mail leads. Internet Leads- Internet leads are generated through opt-in forms. Aged Leads- Aged leads are leads who are a little older. They've usually requested information about a mortgage 30, 60, or 90 days before. TV and Radio Leads- Lead generation companies run mortgage ads on TV or radio. The people who respond become leads. Mortgage Lead Lists- A lead list is a list of leads generated from a variety of different methods. Lists typically include the lead's phone number, email address, and postal address. , The most important part of using a lead generation company is to find one that is reputable. Make sure that the leads company fits your needs. If you are wanting exclusive leads make sure that you find a company that can offer that. If you are needing the leads to be filtered by location or credit score, find a company that can offer that.",

        "text": "Hello! Welcome back to another tutorial by Paper Chaser TO. Today we'll be learning how to make a Waterfall card . Materials:TemplateCardstock Metal Corked Back Ruler Tape Box Cutter / X-Acto Knife Adhesives Scissors After you've gathered all the materials, we're going to start with the Waterfall template. Cut and separate each of the pieces with your scissors.Once that's done, we're going to start with Piece A. Grab a piece of cardstock and tape Piece A onto the cardstock. Then you're going to want to get your scissors and cut along the solid lines.For those who don't have a scoreboard at home, grab your metal ruler, and use the back of your knife to score along the dotted line. If you do have a scoreboard, score it at three-eighths of an inch. Only score it once!Now we'll move onto Piece B. Tape it onto the card stock the same way you did with Piece A. Get your knife and cut along the solid lines on the inside of the card. If you have a thick cardstock, you might have to cut along the lines a few times. Finish off by cutting along the dotted lines to get the square out.You'll want to score Piece B at three-eighths of an inch on the inside square. Score this piece three times.For Pieces C, D, and E I'll be taping them onto the cardstock and cutting along the solid line. Starting with Piece A, fold along the scoreline. Fold it back and forth. Do the same thing with the three scorelines for Piece B.Grab Piece C and apply glue a quarter of an inch onto the side. You'll want to place this piece onto the scoreline furthest to the right. Make sure to put the piece a little bit to the right of the score line or else this card won't work!Once all the pieces on in place, make sure to open the card up and fold it a few more times! These little things will help improve the cascading effect of the card.Grab Piece A and apply some adhesive onto it. You'll want to flip Piece B over and place Piece A onto the first scoreline.Flip the card back over, and if you pull onto Piece A, you should get the waterfall effect!From here you can add this to a card, scrapbook, or even an explosion box!",

        "text": "Pots and pans are one of the largest space-fillers in your kitchen. Keep them from filling up storage areas by installing a pot rack or individual hooks on an open wall. Another good option is hanging up a piece of pegboard, which will allow you adjust the location of hooks and other hanging apparatus., One way to make an island work in a small kitchen is to make it mobile. This is definitely worth working into your kitchen, as it will add both surface area and storage space, and can be moved out of the way when not in use. You may simply be able to add wheels to a freestanding island you already have, or adapt a cart into a kitchenette.You can also use a build-your-own shelving unit and attach a wood cutting surface, or any surface of your choosing, to the top level with a bit of DIYing. Building your own allows you to customize it with the features that will be most helpful for you. Whatever sort of island you purchase or put together, make sure the wheels have locks so you can securely fix the island when using it. , Want to get rid of that knife block once and for all? Easy: install a magnetic strip designed to hold knives on the wall, ideally near where you like to do your prep work. Make sure the strip is elevated, and ideally above a counter or other feature that will keep any children or pets away.Install a paper towel roll nearby too. After washing a knife, simply wipe it on the towel roll and put it on the magnet strip. , If you're short on dry food storage area, or struggle with a deep pantry that's hard to see or reach into, consider making better use of the space by installing a slide out shelving unit. Slim, tall spice racks or can shelves can slide in and out of surprisingly small spaces that you may not currently be using.",

        "text": "This instructable will show you how you can make a table out of old pallets First you need to get pallets Next gather up supplies-2 hammers -drill-saw -screw, nails-drill bits -sander-tape measure -level - pencil Tear down the pallets so you have individual boards. Don't get to aggressive or you will split the boards Before they come off Lay you boards out so you know the pattern you want the table to be and cut them to fit ***i also added a picture of another table I made showin the pattern on it so you can get different ideas Then cut the bottom side frame boards of the table and I found it is easier to sand these down while they are still apart( sand with rough grit, then fine grit, then extra fine fine grit) after cuttin and sanding them, screw them together and start puttin the table pieces on there. I put other pieces of pallet underside of the table to eliminate screws on the top side of the table. You could also spend a little more money and cut a piece of plywood and put the pallet boards on top of that but I didn't want to spend the extra money. once you have the table screwed together it is time to sand the pallet boards down. Top,bottom, and sides (rough, fine, extra fine grit) make sure it is smooth all over and you can rub you hand everywhere and not get splinters ***when puttin in screws, drill a pilot hole first to avoid splitting wood *** rough grit=60 grit Fine grit =120 grit Extra fine=220 grit Now it's time to install legs for the table. First, figure out how high you want it. In this case the lady wanted the table a little taller than her counters so I made it a little more than 3 foot tall. Then cut the legs, put it supports on the bottom to add stability. And finally make sure it is level and doesn't wobble. If it wobbles find the legs that are to long and make small cuts on them to even them out.( the cuts might only be 1/8 and inch being cut) I found it's easier to sand the leg pieces individually to before assembling them Now that the table is assembled and sanded down its time for stain! I choose a light color stain to match the persons counter tops. Put a coat of stain on the whole table make sure you don't put to much or it will make run marks. And then let dry. After it has dried you can sand it down with some 320 grit sand paper and put on a second coat( each time you add a coat it makes the color a little darker and richer looking) once you finish staining the table is complete! Have fun! Vote for contest!",

        "text": "Round and princess cut diamonds are among the most common and most inexpensive shapes. Stick with one of these shapes if you need to save money or do not know your partner's preference. Otherwise, you may also consider an emerald, oval, pear, marquise, radiant, heart, asscher, or cushion shape. , Most traditional engagement bands are made of yellow gold. It's better to choose yellow gold for a vintage-style or classic look. White gold suits clean, modern look. White gold engagement rings will need to be dipped in rhodium every 2-3 years in order to maintain the luster. White gold has a silver-like appearance, but this appearance wears off over time and may need replacing later on. Platinum is the most expensive option and may not be affordable if you are on a tight budget. , Setting refers to the way the diamond sits on the band. The most common setting is prong, but others include bar, tension, bezel, channel, flush, cluster, and invisible. Prong settings may often be the least expensive option, but look at a variety of different options before settling. Many others may also fall within your price range. , Some settings may even have diamonds all around the band. Just remember that the more diamonds a band has, the more expensive it will be. Stick with the traditional, timeless solitaire setting to save on cost. , Some people may actually prefer a high-quality colored gemstone such as a sapphire, emerald, or ruby. Do not, however, try to pass off cubic zirconia or other gemstone as a diamond.",

        "text": "Many salons offer professional waxing services. They use hot wax to remove hair from the follicle. Professional waxes are thorough, though often costlier than at-home treatments. Salons may offer a half or full arm wax depending on where your hair grows. Make sure you find a hygenic, experienced technician if you choose to get professional waxing services. , Laser hair removal uses concentrated beams of light to penetrate the hair follicle and destroy the hair. It is certified by the FDA to permanently reduce hair. This means that hair growth will be reduced over time, and hair may be completely gone for years at a time. Many patients will need multiple treatments to keep hair from growing back. This is not a permanent solution, but may last for years. There are few side effects, although treatments can cause pain afterward. This pain is usually treated with over the counter medication. Visit a dermatologic surgeon to get laser hair removal done. Make sure you find a doctor experienced and trained in performing laser hair removal. , Electrolysis is the only permanent method of hair removal according to the FDA and the American Medical Association. In electrolysis, an electrode is inserted into the skin and an electric current passes through the hair follicle, inhibiting hair growth. It is not painful, though may cause some redness after each treatment. Patients will need a series of treatments over time, with each treatment lasting 15-20 minutes. You must be a licensed and certified technician in order to perform electrolysis, so make sure the doctor you choose has a license before undergoing the procedure.",

Avoid drugs, alcohol, and other unhealthy lifestyle choices. , If you want to stay on top of the fighting game, you're going to have to keep fighting. Taking too much time off might allow people to forget your skills and let you slip in people's estimation of your talents. Treat your training as a job and your fights as a promotion. Constantly work toward the next victory and the next rung on the ladder. , Few fighters will retire undefeated. If you're beaten, go back to the gym and get training. Do your best to forget about the losses, and avoid becoming overconfident about your victories. A fighter should always be eager to prove that he's the best. Challenge fighters that are better than you to continue honing your skills and get better. Michael Jordan used to tape negative criticism (even if it wasn't that negative) to his locker to motivate himself for games. A good fighter will adopt a similar attitude. Prove yourself to the crowd, to the other fighters, and to yourself. , Eventually, a career as a fighter will end if you don't make it to the top.

A spreadsheet will electronically calculate the sum total of your data. Most spreadsheet software will also calculate averages, multiples and a great many mathematical formulas, quicker than it can be done manually.; , Storage: Not only can you use the spreadsheet to collect and calculate data, it is a great way to store data, on a simple file on your computer. This paperless system not only keeps your carbon footprint small, it saves space, time and physical storage. Search Files: A computer spreadsheet will have a search function that allows you to quickly source specific information on your document that would involve a manual search on paper. For larger documents, this saves a lot of time and manpower. Transferable: With an electronic file, a document containing spreadsheets can be emailed to your colleges and clients. Faxing and mailing documents is time-consuming and costly. Calculate Data: Using the spreadsheet to calculate, formulate and total your data will minimize the risk of human error in calculations and allow you to use multiple mathematical formulas to effectively display your results. , A spreadsheet will make your work easier if your data is too involved to manage on paper. Although the process of input might be lengthy for larger documents, the storage, search and emailing capabilities will make your material easier to manage, easier to archive and much easier to share with others.",

        "text": "Pour your desired measurement of rice into your pressure cooker. Add water according to the type and quantity of rice you are using. One cup of white rice, for instance, needs 1.5 cups of water.Substitute all or part of the water with a liquid for flavoring if you wish, such as chicken broth, vegetable broth, or prepared bouillion. Never fill the pressure cooker more than halfway with the rice and liquid. Add a teaspoon of butter, olive oil, or an oil of your choice to the rice for flavor if you like.; , Close and lock the lid on your pressure cooker by fastening the handle of the cover to the handle for the body of the pot, or however your model is intended to close according to the instruction manual. Place the cooker on a burner of your stove. If you are using an electric pressure cooker, plug it into an outlet and turn it on. , Set the burner on your stove to high heat until your pressure cooker indicates high pressure, then lower the heat to maintain this pressure for three minutes. Check your specific instruction manual for how to properly read the pressure on your cooker. If you are using an electric pressure cooker, set it to high pressure for three minutes. The cooker will take a few minutes to pressure up before the three minutes of cooking time.Lower the heat right away after your cooker reaches high pressure, otherwise your rice can become quickly overcooked., When the three minutes cooking time is up, take the pressure cooker off the burner for a 10-minute natural pressure release, meaning the pressure built up inside releases naturally when taken off of heat. The rice will continue to cook while the pressure is slowly released. For an electric cooker, turn it off when the timer beeps and set it to a natural pressure release for 10 minutes., After 10 minutes of natural release, do a quick release on your pressure cooker to open the lid. Tilt the cooker away from you when opening the lid to avoid the hot steam.Fluff the rice with a fork and serve.",

        "text": "You don't want to be pulling down on the handle bars. If you do that, you'll essentially be fighting against the bike. If the road is bumpy or has potholes then your handlebars are bound to jerk around a little bit. Allow for these small movements. , Since you won't be gripping onto the handlebars with your arms really tightly, it's important to anchor yourself by hugging the motorcycle with your knees. It doesn't need to be a death grip, just enough to keep you sturdy. You can also hold down on the pegs with the heels of your boot. , If you have to decelerate, downshift, or, worst of all, brake, in the turn then you have entered the turn too quickly. Brake before the turn, consider your entering strategy, and then enter it smoothly. You may want to enter the turn differently depending on the camber of the road and the type of turn, but generally use the delayed apex strategy. This means entering the turn on the outside and then scooting back to the inside as you clear the apex of the turn.",

Get the following supplies ready: A lighter An almond Olive oil Tweezers A spoon A chopstick A small container , Grasp the almond in the tweezers and use the lighter to burn it. Keep using the lighter to burn the almond until its surface has turned to black ash. Don't use an almond that has been flavored or smoked, since it might contain ingredients that could irritate your eyes. If you fear the lighter will get too hot to hold, hold the almond up to a candle flame instead. , Scrape off the ash into a spoon or small dish. Use the back of a spoon to crush up the chunks in the ash, grinding it to a smooth powder. , Add a drop or two of oil to the powder and mix it in using a chopstick. If you like your eyeliner to be on the dry side, add only a drop of oil. If you prefer eyeliner that is easy to glide on, add a few extra drops. Be careful not to add too much oil, or your eyeliner could run once you apply it. Jojoba oil and almond oil can be substituted for olive oil. Just make sure you use an oil approved for cosmetic use. , An old chap stick pot, eyeshadow container or any small container with a lid will do. When it's time to apply the eyeliner, use an eyeliner blush and apply it as you would other liquid eyeliners.",

        "text": "Ever since Paracord and Canvas first met, they've been best friends. So, it only makes sense that they should be together, like on converses. This Instructable will show you how to switch out your lame old shoelaces for some hardcore 550 Paracord. Psst! (This is in the paracord contest... You should vote for it...If you want to, thanks!) To successfully up the cool factor of your shoes, you'll need: @ 550 Paracord, about the same size as other shoelaces. (If you're buying new paracord just for this,becauseI'm so convincing (Ha!) I would get no more than 50 feet.) You'll use about 4 feet per shoe, depending on what kind of shoe you have. @ Scissors, or a Pocketknife, if you prefer. @ A Pair of shoes (Shoelaces Optional) @ A Cigarette Lighter You'll need to measure out the paracord, to make sure that it is the same length as your shoelaces. Remember measure twice, cut once. You don't need a ruler for this, just take out one of your shoelaces and straighten it as much as you can, then put one end of the paracord next to one end of the shoelace, and wind out the paracord, and cut it at the end of the shoelace, so it is the same length as the shoelace. It doesn't have to be perfect, but close enough. Done with step 1! Achtung! There is fire involved with this step, so be careful, unless you like melted Nylon on your skin / pain. For this part, you'll want to fuse the paracord, not whip it, fusing will just make it easier to work with, and double as aglets. If you are using a brand new bundle of paracord, or are at the very end of the cord, one end will be fused already. If not, you'll just have to do this step twice. Holding near the frayed end of the paracord, but not at the very end, light it up! Wait for the inner cords to start melting. It's alright if there's a tiny flame, it will probably burn itself out, but be careful! Now, lace your shoes up any way you want, there are a myriad of instructables about just that (1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6,etc.) I laced mine up the normal way, but it's all up to you. You'll find that it helps that you fused the paracord, it makes going through the holes easier. It is a bit different using paracord, but you get used to it. Once you're done lacing your shoe, put your foot inside and tie that sucker! If you are planning on lacing both shoes with paracord, repeat this process twice. Well, now you're ready to hit the town in style, knowing that your shoes will fall apart before your shoelaces come apart! Secretly, I was planning on taking this off after I was done, and switching back to my old shoelace. But, I'm really happy with the results, and am sticking with this. Thanks for reading!!",

This can destroy the insulation of the wires and leave them exposed, which could cause an electrical fire. When installing the lights, make sure that they have a clear path that won't be disturbed. Do not put wires across walkways where there will be a lot of foot traffic and refrain from having wires hang down at head height.Use the instructions found inside of the light packaging. , When hanging your lights up on a window or your house's gutters, it's important that you hooks that are made specifically for hanging holiday lights. There are multi-purpose plastic hooks that you can purchase at many hardware stores or online.You can also get individual holders for each light bulb that will help hold them in place and will help you be more precise with the layout of your light display., You should have already tested the lights on the ground to ensure that they work before trying to install them. Do not install lights while they are plugged in. An unplanned short could electrocute you, or you could damage the light socket or your string of lights if you leave them connected., Make sure to occasionally turn off your lights when you are sleeping or are out of the house.

Toss the ball up with your left hand, then take a step with your left foot as you hit the ball with your right hand. Be sure to snap your wrist. Ideally, the ball will bounce right where the floor meets the wall. Then, catch the ball and repeat. , Stand ten to fifteen feet from the wall. Toss the ball up so that it is higher than your head and just a little bit in front of you. Then set it to the wall. Your sets should be nice and high and they should go in a bit of an arc. You can either catch the ball and repeat, or you can just set the ball as it is bouncing back to you. , This is very easy to do. You can do it while watching TV or just when you are feeling bored. All you need to do is lay down and set the ball straight up to yourself. Keep the sets going for as long as possible. , All you have to do is get into passing position and pass the ball straight up to yourself. Try to keep the ball from dropping. You can even count the number of passes and try to beat your record. , Measure 7'3\" on the wall (higher or lower depending on what net height you usually play at) and mark the spot with a bit of masking tape. Stand 30 feet (9.1m) from the wall. Toss the ball up with your left hand and hit with your right hand as you are stepping with your left foot. You should be aiming to have the ball hit just above the tape. You can also practice your jump serving or underhand serving.",

Try serving some food items like mini sandwiches, deviled eggs, pigs in a blanket, or veggie platters with various dips. For the drinks, consider some kind of cola, water, punch, wine, and/or champagne. , Some people might have masks with a handle, so the food should not be too complicated (or require both hands to eat). Include finger foods and beverages that go with the theme of your party.For example, if you are hosting a Mardi Gras themed masquerade party, you could include some mini New Orleans styled food like jambalaya and beignets.Provide straws for your guests so they can drink easily, even with a full-face mask. , When everyone's arrived at your party, make a short opening announcement explaining the rules (don't make too many rules; you don't want to restrict the guests too much) and tell everyone that other than those few rules, they are welcome to do whatever they like. As the host of the party, it is your responsibility to ensure that everyone has a good time and knows what is going on during the party. , At midnight, there should be a moment when everyone unmasks themselves to unveil their identities to their fellow revelers. This should be a fun moment for all of your guests as they get to see who has been hiding behind the masks all night.As the host, you should announce the unveiling at midnight and encourage your guests to cheer and laugh as they do so.",

However, if your coin has any special collector's value, you should do everything you can to make sure that it experiences no decay. , The face is the most important part of the coin. You do not want to damage the engraving. So, when picking up your coins, always grab them by the edges, touching the surface as little as possible., If you do drop your coin, ensure that it doesn't fall on a hard wood or stone surface. If you working over such a surface, just place a towel or cloth underneath you to protect your investment., Your coins do not appreciate moisture. Refrain from using saliva to try to clean them; it will only make matters worse. Similarly, don't breathe hard on it to try to blow off dust. Keep all biological elements as far from your coins as possible., There are some products that are marketed commercially to clean coins. Most are abrasive and will remove silver, significantly decreasing the value of the coin. Even tap water can cause damage to your coin. Do not attempt to clean any coins on your own.",

You will want to work with spray adhesive outdoors, since it can contain chemicals that are harmful to breathe. You can find spray adhesive at any craft store or major retailer. If you are unable to work outside, work in a well-ventilated area. , Be sure to follow any special directions from the manufacturer, if applicable. Hold the spray adhesive can a few inches away from the wood and press down on the top of the can to spray the wood. , While the adhesive spray is still wet on the wood, sprinkle your glitter over the area. The amount of glitter that you use will determine how sparkly the wood is. You can either sprinkle the glitter onto the area with your hands, or use a foam wedge or paintbrush to apply the glitter. , The drying time will depend upon the specific adhesive spray that you use, but it should only take a few minutes for the area to completely dry. , If you'd like, you can apply a sealant, like decoupage, to the area. The sealant will add smoothness and will help to prevent the glitter from falling off. Choose a sealant that has a glossy finish, not matte, so your glitter doesn't lose any of its sparkle.Once the adhesive spray is dry, you can shake off any excess glitter into your cardboard box.",

For example, if your cat likes chasing a laser pointer, you might consider an automated laser toy. If your cat likes pouncing on a plush mouse, you might buy an automated mouse toy. If your cat likes leaping, consider a hanging toy. If your cat likes running, consider a toy that moves across the floor.; , Make sure you choose a cat toy that is made of materials that are safe for cats. For example, you should not buy a toy that is made of small objects like beads, beans, or nutshells. A cat can easily choke on or consume these materials, quickly turning playtime into a visit to the vet., Before you buy a toy, inspect its integrity and construction. Cat toys should be free from loose parts, sharp edges, and metal. If you notice a component of the toy that could be potentially dangerous for your cat, do not purchase the toy.",

When the food is collected, it must be sorted and inventoried so the group responsible for distribution can arrange carrying out that job.; , Local food banks, relief organizations, the Salvation Army, or religious institutions are examples. , You will also need to make sure the items you sort will be safe there. , Coordinate this with the volunteers you are assembling and the organization you are doing the project for. , Sorting donated clothing may be accomplished best using a variety of cardboard boxes, so check with merchants to see if they can save good, clean boxes of assorted sizes sufficient for task. Plastic or paper grocery bags might work fine for foodstuffs. , If none are willing to help, take up a collection among the volunteers themselves, or provide them yourself. , Local newspapers or radio stations may be willing to give free advertising or airtime for the event, and it may be possible to have live broadcasts from the local media for large events. This might help increase the charity's community support. , Once you have taken the donated articles out of their original containers or packaging, they should be sorted and repackaged or placed in containers before you quit the project.",
